preface. 



THE character and the purpose of this book are clearly 
indicated by its title. It is a book of devotions and pray 
ers designed and specially adapted for the use of Relig 
ious. It offers itself to them as a helpful companion in 
all the exercises of religion ; it aims to assist them in the 
particular and general examination; to instruct them in 
the correct and practical methods of making a meditation, 
and to direct them how to converse with God most prop 
erly and profitably in mental and vocal prayer. 

It supplies them with abundant devotions and prayers 
for all the seasons of the ecclesiastical year. 

A member of one of our most illustrious Religious 
Orders remarked one day quite casually in our presence, 
when devotional literature was the topic of conversation : 
"What we need in English is a complete Prayer-book to 
meet the special wants of Religious, so that a Mistress of 
Novices may be able to say to inquiring aspirants to the 
religious life: Besides the Roman Missal, I recommend 
to you this particular book; then you will surely have 
what will prove most serviceable in the convent for the 
hours of devotion. 

Acting on this inspiration or suggestion, we have de 
voted much time and spared no, pains in the compilation 
and adaptation of the present work. It is the result at 
least of honest effort to meet the wants of our various 
Sisterhoods, and it comprises, indeed, a number of little 
Dooks under one title. 



viii Preface. 

which were approved since 1902, are from The New 
Raccolta. 

This book is dedicated most respectfully to the mem 
bers of our Religious Orders, whose heroic life of 
self-denial for the love of God and their neighbor, in the 
following of Christ and in the spirit of their vows of obedi 
ence, chastity, and poverty, is an inspiration and encour 
agement to all who value truth and justice, virtue and 
holiness, while it is, at the same time, a rebuke to the 
worldly-minded, who walk not with God, whose thoughts 
are not of heaven, but of earth, and who, in their nervous 
quest for honor, wealth, and pleasure, in these times of 
individualism or egotism, seek simply the gratification of 
self. 

We plead with these good and edifying Religious for 
an occasional Memento before Jesus in the taSernacle.

BOOK I. 



flDefcttatfon, prater, anfc tbe particular 
Bjamen. 



THE APOSTLES CREED. 

BELIEVE in God, the Father almighty, Creator of 
heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only 
Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, 
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
was crucified : died, and was buried. He descended into 
hell: the third day He arose again from the dead: He as 
cended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the 
Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge 
the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, 
the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the 
f &amp;gt;rgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the 
life everlasting. Amen. 

CREED OF ST. ATHANASIUS. 

/TJ-fHOSOEVER will be saved, before all things it is 
^%A&amp;gt; necessary that he hold the Catholic faith. 

Which faith, except every one do keep entire and invio 
late, without doubt :^e shall perish everlastingly. 

Now the Catholic faith is this, that we worship one God 
m Trinity, and Trinity in Unity. 

Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the sub 
stance. 

For there is one Person of the Father, another of the 
Son, another of the Holy Ghost. 

33 



34 The Creeds. 

But the Godhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Ghost, is all one; the glory equal, the majesty 
coeternal. 

Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the 
Holy Ghost. 

The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, the Holy Ghost 
uncreate. 

The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehen 
sible, the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. 

The Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Ghost 
eternal. 

And yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal. 

As also they are not three uncreates, nor three incom- 
prehensibles; but one uncreate, and one incomprehen 
sible. 

In like manner the Father is Almighty, the Son A. 
mighty, and the Holy Ghost Almighty. 

And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Al 
mighty. 

So the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost 
God. 

And yet they are not three Gods, but one God. 

So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the 
Holy Ghost is Lord. 

And yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord. 

For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to 
acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and 
Lord: 

So we are forbidden by the Catholic religion to say 
there are three Gods or three Lords. 

The Father is made of none, neither created, nor be 
gotten. 

The Son is from the Father alone, not made, nor cre 
ated, but begotten. 

The Holy Ghost is from the Father and the Son, not 
made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. 

So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one 



The Creeds. 35 

Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy 
Ghosts. 

And in this Trinity there is nothing before or after 
nothing greater or less; but the whole three Persons are 
coeternal together, and coequal. 

So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity is to be 
worshipped in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity. 

He, therefore, that will be saved, must thus think of the 
Trinity. 

Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation, 
that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of Our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

Now the right faith is, that we believe and confess that 
Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and 
man. 

He is God of the substance of His Father, begotten 
before the world ; and He is man of the substance of His 
Mother, born in the world: 

Perfect God and perfect man; of reasonable soul and 
human flesh subsisting. 

Equal to the Father according to His Godhead; and 
less than +he Father according to His manhood. 

Who, although He be both God and man, yet He is not 
two but one Christ: 

One, not by the conversion of the Godhead into flesh, 
but by the taking of the manhood unto God: 

One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by 
unity of person. 

For as the reasonable soul and the flesh is one man, so 
God and man is one Christ. 

Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, 
rose again the third day from the dead. 

He ascended into heaven ; He sitteth at the right hand 
of God the Father almighty; from whence He shall come 
to judge the living and the dead. 

At Whose coming all men shall rise again with their 
bodies, and shall give an account of their own works. 



36 The Creeds. 

And they that have done good shall go into life ever 
lasting: and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. 

This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe 
faithfully and steadfastly, he can not be saved. 

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy 
Ghost. 

As it was in the beginning, is now ..and ever shall be, 
world without end. Amen. 

NICENE CREED. 

I BELIEVE in one God, the Father almighty, Maker 
of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and 
invisible. 

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son 
of God, born of the Father before all ages. God of God; 
Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; 
consubstantial with the Father, by Whom all things were 
made. Who for us men, and for our salvation, came 
down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost 
of the Virgin Mary: AND WAS MADE MAN. {Kneel in 
reverence of Christ s Incarnation.] He was crucified also 
for us, suffered under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. 
The third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; 
and ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand 
of the Father: and He shall come again with glory to 
judge both the living and the dead: of Whose kingdom 
there shall be no end. 

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Life- 
giver, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son : Who 
together with the Father and the Son is adored and glori 
fied : Who spake by the prophets. And one Holy, Catho 
lic, and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for 
the remission of sins. And I look for the resurrection of 
the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. 



Profession of Faith for Converts. 37 



PROFESSION OF FAITH AT THE RECEPTION OF CONVERTS 
INTO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. 

u r , N.N., having before my eyes the holy Gospels, which 
-*&amp;gt; I touch with my hand, and knowing that no one can 
be saved without that faith which the Holy, Catholic, 
Apostolic Roman Church holds, believes, and teaches, 
against which I grieve that I have greatly erred, inasmuch 
as I have held and believed doctrines opposed to her 
teaching. 

I now, with grief and contrition for my past errors, 
profess that I believe the Holy, Catholic, Apostolic Ro 
man Church to be the only and true Church * established 

* Out oj the Catholic Church none can be saved. This propo 
sition, which highly displeases all sectarians and infidels, is not 
only clearly established by the authority of Scripture, and by the 
perpetual and constant belief of the Catholic Church, but it is 
also evident from reason itself, so that one must needs be blind 
who does not perceive its truth. This, however, applies only to 
those persons who cuipably and wilfully adhere to heresy, or 
schism, or infidelity, but by no means to those who have been 
imbued with errors and prejudices from their earliest years, and 
to whom not even a doubt occurs that they are involved in heresy 
or schism, or who, if any doubt arises in their minds, earnestly 
and sincerely seek after the truth; such persons we leave to the 
judgment of God, to whom it belongs to penetrate and search 
the thoughts and dispositions of hearts. For it is incompatible 
with the divine goodness and clemency that any one should suffer 
eternal torments who is not guilty of a wilful transgression. To 
assert the contrary would be against the express doctrine of the 
Church. 

"Let us hear St. Augustine: We must not, says he, class 
among heretics those persons who, without wilful obstinacy, main 
tain a false and perverse doctrine, especially if it is not the^off- 
spring of their bold presumption, but a legacy from their deceived 
and mistaken parents, and who search after the truth with earnest 
care, being disposed to renounce their error as soon as they are 
apprised of it. Epist. 43, Edit. Benedict, alias 162. A long list 

of other Fathers might be cited who are of the same opinion It 

follows from what has been said that every one is bound, to the 
best of his power, to consider the doub*9 which sometimes occur 



38 Profession of Faith for Converts, 

on earth by Jesus Christ, to which I submit myself with 
my whole heart. I believe all the articles that she pro 
poses to my belief, and I reject and condemn all that she 
rejects and condemns, and I am ready to observe all that 
she commands me. And especially, I profess that I 
believe : 

One only God in three divine Persons, distinct from, 
and equal to, each other that is to say, the Father, the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost: 

The Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation, Passion, 
Death, and Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ: and 
the personal union of the two natures, the divine and the 
human ; the divine maternity of the most holy Mary, to 
gether with her most spotless virginity; 

The true, real, and substantial presence of the body 
and blood, together with the soul and divinity of Our 
Lord Jesus Christ, in the Most Holy Sacrament of the 
Eucharist ; 

The seven sacraments instituted by Jesus Christ for 
the salvation of mankind; that is to say, Baptism, Con 
firmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, 
Matrimony; 

Purgatory, the resurrection of the dead, everlasting life; 

The Primacy, not only of honor, but also of jurisdic 
tion of the Roman Pontiff, successor of St. Peter, Prince 
of the Apostles, Vicar of Jesus Christ; 

The veneration of the saints, and of their images; 

The authority of the apostolic and ecclesiastical tra 
ditions, and of the Holy Scriptures, which we must inter 
pret, and understand only in the sense which our holy 
Mother the Catholic Church has held, and does hold; 

And everything else that has been defined, and declared 
by the sacred Canons, and by the General Councils, and 

to him, and to investigate the truth, and when he has found it, to 
embrace it without delay; unless he wish to live under an habitual 
and most grievous guilt, and, by deferring his conversion, expose 
himself to a manifest danger of eternal damnation."

particularly by the holy Council of Trent, and delivered, 
denned, and declared by the General Council of the Vati 
can, especially concerning the Primacy of the Roman 
Pontiff, and his infallible teaching authority. 

With a sincere heart, therefore, and with unfeigned 
faith, I detest and abjure every error, heresy, and sect 
opposed to the said Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Roman 
Church. So help me God, and these His holy Gospels, 
which I touch with my hand. 



prayer. 

"He who prayeth shall certainly save his soul; he who 
prayeth not shall certainly lose it." 



justly celebrated sentence of St. Alphonsus 
Liguori, who may well be called the "Doctor of 
Prayer," finds a fitting place at the beginning of this 
book of devotions for Religious, It was neither lightly 
nor by chance that St. Alphonsus wrote these solemn 
words. Their truth had been impressed upon his mind 
during his long experience as a missionary priest, and in 
confirmation of it many proofs from Holy Writ and from 
tradition are adduced by the holy Doctor in his treatise 
on prayer. 

St. Alphonsus writes: "Prayer is a sure and indis 
pensable means of obtaining salvation and all the graces 
leading thereto. Convinced as I am of the necessity of 
prayer, I say that all books treating of spiritual subjects, 
all preachers in their sermons, all confessors in every 
confession which they hear, should attach the greatest 
importance to inculcating the necessity of constant 
prayer on the minds of their readers and hearers, and 
they should never tire of impressing it on them and of 
repeating over and over again: Pray, pray always; 
if you pray, you will certainly save your souls ; if you do 
not pray, you will certainly lose them. It is true that 
many excellent ways of persevering in the grace of God 
may be recommended to souls; for instance, avoiding 
occasions of sin, frequenting the sacraments, resisting 
temptation, listening to sermons, meditating on the 

40 



Prayer. 41 

eternal truths, etc., all of which are most salutary prac 
tices, as every one must admit; but, I ask, of what good 
are sermons, meditations, and the other means suggested 
by the masters of the spiritual life, without prayer? since 
Our Lord has declared that He will only grant His grace 
to those who pray for it: Ask and ye shall receive (John 
yvi. 24) . According to the ordinary course of Providence, 
all our meditations, resolutions, promises are useless with 
out prayer; if we do not pray, we shall always be faith 
less to the lights we have received from God and to the 
resolutions we have taken. Because, in order to do right, 
to overcome temptation, to practise virtue, to observe 
God s law, it is not sufficient to have received divine 
lights, to have meditated, and to have taken firm reso 
lutions. God s actual help is also necessary. Now, this 
actual help is only granted by Our Lord to those who 
pray perseveringly for it. The lights we receive, and 
the earnest consideration and firm resolutions which we 
make, have the effect of inciting us to have recourse to 
prayer in the time of temptation and when in danger of 
offending God: by prayer we obtain the divine help 
necessary for keeping us from sin, and if, under these 
circumstances, we were to neglect praying, we should 
undoubtedly be lost. 

" The texts of Scripture which prove the necessity we 
are under of praying, if we wish to be saved, are extremely 
clear: We ought always to pray (Luke xviii. i). Watch 
ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation (Matt. 
xxvi. 41). Ask, and it shall be given you (Matt. 
vii. 7). 

" Theologians are of opinion that this way of speaking 
imposes the precept and denotes the necessity of prayer. 
Hence the learned Lessius asserts that it can not be denied, 
without sinning against faith, that for adults prayer is 
necessary to salvation. 

" The reason of this is that, without the help of grace, 
we can do nothing good. Without Me, says Jesus Christ, 



42 Prayer. 

you can do nothing (John xv. 5) . St. Augustine remarks 
on this subject that Our Saviour did not say, You can 
complete nothing without Me; but, You can do nothing. 
This truth was proclaimed at the second Council of 
Orange, when it was denned that man does no good thing 
except what God enables him to do by the operations of 
His grace. Man is therefore quite unable to work out 
his own salvation unassisted, since it is God s will that all 
he has or can have should come to him by the help of 
grace. Now, this grace God only grants, in the ordinary 
course of His providence, to those who pray for it. Ac 
cording to the maxim laid down by Gennadius, No man 
can attain salvation without the help of God; no man can 
obtain this help except by prayer. This does not mean, 
says St. Thomas, that it is necessary for us to pray in 
order that God may know of what we stand in need; 
but that we must pray in order that we ourselves may 
understand our need of having recourse to God to obtain 
the aid necessary for our salvation, and may thus acknowl 
edge Him as the only author of all our good."

are remitted by that sacrament, there still remain concu

devil to attack us from without. St. Thomas. All the

Augustine. To prayer may be traced the beginning, 
the progress, and the perfection of all virtues. St. 
Charles Borromeo. Who are we, or what is our strength,

should, with all humility, have recourse to His mercy.

tfor Wbat an&amp;gt; for Wbom We Sbouto 



. ALPHONSUS LIGUORI insists repeatedly that 
in all our devotions, at Mass, at holy communion, 
in all our visits to the Blessed Sacrament, we should 
pray for these four graces for ourselves, viz.: the for 
giveness of our sins, the love of God, the love of prayer. 
and final perseverance. When these graces are secured, 
our salvation is assured. 

Furthermore, Religious should, in all their prayers 
and good works, unite themselves intimately with our 
holy Mother the Church, in her three intentions: 

1. To glorify God; to venerate the Blessed Virgin 
Mary, the angels and the saints; the Church trium 
phant. 

2. To provide for the spiritual and temporal necessi 
ties of the children of the Church militant. 

3. To procure the deliverance of the holy souls in pur 
gatory, that is, to aid the Church suffering. 

The Morning Offering of the Apostleship of Prayer is 
very efficacious. 

" O my God, I offer Thee my prayers, works, and suffer 
ings this day in union with the Sacred Heart of Jesus, for 
the intentions for which He pleads and offers Himself in 
holy Mass, in thanksgiving for Thy favors, in reparation 
for our offences, and for the petitions of all our Associ 
ates." 



46 For What and for Whom We Should Pra\ . 

Religious should say the beads, hear Mass, and offer 
holy communion frequently for our holy Mother the 
Church, for our holy Father the Pope, for bishops, 
priests, and superiors, for the needs of our country, 
for universal peace, for the conversion of sinners, and 
all those who do not belong to the one fold of Christ; 
and last, but not least, for the holy, suffering souls in 
purgatory. 

Father Girardey, dwelling on the subject of prayer, 
writes: 

"In praying for temporal favors for ourselves, we can 
claim unconditionally only the necessaries of life, for in 
the Our Father our daily bread is equivalent to the 
necessaries of life, but does not include its superfluities 
or luxuries; and the words deliver us from evil do not 
necessarily include, as we have seen, deliverance from 
physical evils, for the evil here meant is sin and all that 
leads to sin. We have no reason to hope that God will 
hear our prayers for those temporal favors that may prove 
hurtful to our salvation, or that He will exempt us from 
certain corporal pains and trials, if such an exemption 
would lead us to sin or endanger our salvation. Tne 
granting of such prayers would be, not a favor, but a 
terrible punishment. We should, then, ask for temporal 
favors conditionally that is, under the condition that 
they may promote our salvation, or at least not hinder it. 
We ought never to lose sight of this saying of our loving 
Redeemer: What doth it profit a man, if he gain the 
whole world, and suffer the loss of his own soul ? (Mat.. 
xvi. 26.) 

"Let us not be so solicitous for temporal favors, which, 
after all, may, as we have seen, prove hurtful to our soul, 
but let us rather pray for what is conducive to our eterna. 
welfare. When we pray for temporals, and God, in Hit, 
mercy, refuses them to us, it is because they would prove 
hurtful to us. But, says St. Gregory of Nazianzen, he 
who asks God for a real favor (that is, for a favor that is 



For What and for Whom We Should Pray. 47 

necessary or useful for his salvation), obtains it, for God 
is bountiful and generous, and readily bestows His gifts. 
When you pray/ says St. Ambrose, ask for great things ; 
ask not for what is transitory, but for what is eternal. 
We should pray, says St. Augustine, in the name and 
through the merits of Jesus Christ. When, however, 
we pray for what is injurious to our soul, we do not pray 
in the name of Our Redeemer. In praying for temporals 
we should be moderate and timid, asking God to give 
them to us provided they are really beneficial, and to 
withhold them if they should prove hurtful. Many, 
when they pray, invoke God, but not as God, for the 
object of their prayer is opposed to His glory and favor 
able to their passions. They seem to consider God as a 
mere servant of themselves and of their passions, such as 
pride, covetousness, and lust. Let us pray, not for tem 
porals, but for heavenly glory and the means of attaining 
it. The most precious and excellent of temporal things 
are but insignificant trifles in comparison to what is 
eternal. 

"Rohrbacher relates in his Church History that, 
among the pilgrims who flocked to the tomb of St. 
Thomas of Canterbury to seek favors through the saint s 
intercession, there was a blind man who prayed so fer 
vently for the recovery of his lost sight that he was per 
fectly cured. After returning home, however, he began 
to reflect that the restoration of his sight might, perhaps, 
prove an obstacle to his salvation. He accordingly re 
turned to the tomb of the saint, and, after fervently 
praying that were his sight ever to be injurious to his 
soul he should again lose it, he became totally blind once 
more. He acted most wisely, for it was much better for 
him to be blind than run the risk of losing his soul. Un 
guarded looks are often the cause of grievous sin, as is 
shown by the example of David and of many others. 

"When our prayers for temporal favors, either for 
ourselves or in behalf of others, are not granted, we should 



48 For What and -for Whom We Should Pray. 

consider God s refusal a real benefit rather than a mis 
fortune. In beseeching God for temporals we should be 
indifferent as to the result of our prayers, being equally 
ready to accept a refusal or a favorable hearing from 
Him. If such should be our dispositions, God, when 
refusing our request, will not fail to compensate us by 
bestowing on us more excellent favors which we do not 
think of asking. In vain does a child cry for a sword 
or a live coal, remarks St John Chrysostom ; his parents 
justly refuse him what may prove very hurtful to him. 
In like manner, God justly and kindly refuses us what is 
injurious to us; but, in His goodness, He will give us 
something better instead. Let us in all our prayers aim 
principally at the salvation of our soul, and we shall ob 
tain also temporal favors from God, according to this 
saying of our loving Redeemer: Seek ye therefore first 
the kingdom of God, and His justice: and all these 
things shall be added unto you (Matt. vi. 33). 

"For whom should we pray? We should, first of all, 
pray for ourselves, because our salvation is our first and 
most important duty. Although, by the law of charity, 
we are bound to pray for all men, there are, nevertheless, 
some for whom we have a special obligation or special 
reasons to pray. Children should daily pray for their 
parents, parents for their children, members of the same 
family and household or community for one another, 
inferiors for their superiors, both ecclesiastical and civil, 
and superiors for their inferiors. It is also incumbent 
on us to pray for our benefactors, both spiritual and 
temporal, for our relatives, for those who ask our prayers 
and who pray for us, for our friends, and for our enemies 
also, whosoever they may be or whatever evil they may 
have done or may wish us. We ought, likewise, to pray 
for the perseverance of the just and for the conversion of 
sinners, of heretics, schismatics, Jews, and unbelievers. 
It is a most praiseworthy custom to pray for the sick, 
for those who are in their agony, for all who are in danger 



A Talk about Prayer. 49 

of death, or in danger of losing their innocence, and for 
all who are in distress, pain, trouble, or sorrow. 

"It behooves us daily to remember in our prayers the 
souls in purgatory, particularly the souls toward whom 
we have some special obligation, e.g., the souls of our 
parents, of our benefactors, of those who are suffering 
on our account. We should endeavor to gain many 
indulgences for their benefit. If, during our life, we 
pray for them, God will, after our death, inspire com 
passionate souls to pray for us when we are in purga 
tory, for, says our divine Saviour, with what measure 
you mete, it shall be measured to you again (Matt. vii.

"T*N the first place, we will speak of the ways of making 
* vocal prayer. Besides tLe ordinary way we have of 
reciting our vocal prayers, i.e., a simple repetition oj the 
words, with a general attention to God and to the inten 
tion for which we are reciting them there are two other 
ways, highly recommended by the saints. 

One is to recite the words of the prayer, say, of the 
Our Father, very slowly and thoughtfully, attending to 
the sense of the words, and pausing an instant after each 
sentence or clause, in order to make the meaning of the 
prayer our own. It is well to get into the habit, in fact, 
when we are alone and have enough leisure, of saying 
our prayers slowly and thoughtfully, and with great 
exterior and interior reverence, even though at times we 
may find no devotion in considering the meaning of 
every sentence, but only have in our souls a sense of the 
presence of God. In that case it will be better simply 
to recite the prayer slowly, and with quiet recollection 
of the divine presence. 

* From Spencer s The Little Grain of Wheat." 



5o A Talk about Prayer. 

The other way of reciting vocal prayers, particularly 
the Our Father and the Hail Mary, is, in fact, a method 
of turning vocal into mental prayer. It consists in not 
merely reciting the prayer slowly, but resting at each 
sentence or petition, and meditating upon what is there 
said, or asked of God. It is the method St. Teresa 
taught her nuns, and is a most profitable as well as an 
easy way of meditating. Some people find it very diffi 
cult to make use of mental prayer by the ordinary 
methods. They will not, perhaps, find this method so 
difficult. We will give a rapid sketch of the manner of 
meditating on the Our Father, and of some of the sub 
jects of meditation to be found in it. Those who are not 
able to meditate by reasoning upon points, may find in 
this method great help and encouragement. 

Upon the very first words of this divine prayer of Our 
Lord the soul may rest and find nourishment. It is not 
necessary, having begun the first words of the prayer, to 
go on and finish it; but if, during the whole time of 
prayer, the soul rests upon these or any other words, 
there let her stay as long as she is inclined. Afterwards, 
if there is any more time, let her go on to the next sen 
tence or petition. 

On the words, "Our Father," the soul may consider 
what a great thing it is to be the son or daughter of such 
a great Lord and Sovereign, and what it is to have such 
a Father, Who is almighty, all-loving, all-good, able and 
desirous to help and benefit His child to the uttermost. 
Again, having such a Father in God, His only-begotten 
Son is become our brother, in Whom we are all brethren, 
coheirs with Him, and brethren and fellow-citizens with 
the saints and angels in heaven. And having such a 
Father and such brethren, we should have very great 
confidence that, if we are faithful children, all things will 
cooperate together for our good, and heaven will be ours 
hereafter; and any other such like thoughts that may 
present themselves to our minds. Then we can raise 



A Talk about Prayer. 5 1 

our souls to God in acts of love, thanksgiving, filial fear, 
confidence, and joy, and spend thus as long a time as we 
desire before going on. And all this and much more on 
the first simple words, "Our Father." 

Next come the words "Who art in heaven." Our 
Father is in heaven therefore heaven is our country; 
and the devout soul may make acts of desire and long 
ing for her heavenly home. Again, wherever God is, by 
His grace and love, there is heaven. His presence makes 
heaven. Now we know by divine faith that God is every 
where, and intimately present in all things and in all 
places; therefore, He is present in our own souls; and 
in a special manner, as He is more particularly present 
to spiritual substances than to other things. He is 
present there really and actually, at every moment, by 
His essence and His power, and, let us humbly and con 
fidently trust, also by His grace and love. Therefore, 
heaven is in our souls. Every time we say: " Our Father, 
Who art in heaven," we can look at God continually 
abiding in the very centre and essence of our souls, so 
that He is not far off from us, nor must we go to the 
heavens above to find Him, as St. Teresa says, but He 
is very near to us, as near as our own souls to our own 
bodies. And this all the time, at any and every moment ; 
and with the Father we have the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
So there are the Three Persons of the Trinity, enacting 
their wonderful relations one with another, working 
Their mighty works, upholding the entire universe, all 
within our own soul wondrous thought! And since 
Jesus Christ our Lord is God the Son, then Jesus our 
Lord is present in our souls, making heaven there; and, 
by a sort of spiritual concomitance, we can represent to 
ourselves His sacred humanity as present also, and His 
blessed Mother, too, who is not separated from Him, and 
the saints and angels who constitute His court ; these also 
we can represent to ourselves as present, though in a 
spiritual sense and not with the same actuality that the 



g2 A TaR about Prayer. 

Divinity is present. Since God then, and heaven, are 
present in our souls, at all times and in all places, we 
surely should have but little trouble in finding Him or in 
speaking with Him in our thoughts, or in making Him 
hear us: and this makes it very easy for us in time of 
prayer to form acts of love, etc., and to converse with 
Him. And not only in time of prayer, but at all times, 
all we have to do is to look within, and God is really 
and actually present. This should help us greatly to be 
recollected everywhere, and we should endeavor, little 
by little, to learn to keep up a continual conversation in 
our souls with God, Who is so much nearer to us than 
our dearest friend can ever be. In this way we would 
always be on our guard against offending one who in 
habits our very soul, and we would be habitually filled 
with a holy filial fear and love. The heaven that is 
within our souls by this divine presence will begin to 
project itself upon our surroundings, and we will be 
almost living in heaven, the world about us and our 
lives becoming tinged with its light. Behold all there 
is in the Our Father in this manner of prayer, before we 
come to the first petition. And many other holy thoughts 
with accompanying requests and acts of the will and 
aspirations will present themselves to your minds, a&amp;gt; 
God the Holy Ghost within you may direct. 

" Hallowed be Thy name." In this first petition we 
address God as our Father and Lord ; and as His children 
we pray, and ought greatly to desire, that our lives may 
be sanctified, in order that we may live up to our holy 
vocation as children of such a Father. Let us, then, 
while meditating on tnis petition, greatly desire to be 
come holy, to become saints, as children of God ought 
to be. Then we should make acts of self-contempt and 
indignation against ourselves, because we are so unwor 
thy of such a high dignity, and are so full of sin and 
ingratitude to so good a Father; and make acts of con 
trition for our sins, by which we have offended Him, and 



A Talk about Prayer. 53 

do continually offend Him. We should not be content 
with this, but should grieve over all the sins, crimes, 
sacrileges, and other evils that are continually being 
committed by sinners, since by them God s name is not 
hallowed, but dishonored and outraged. We should 
offer up the most precious blood in satisfaction for all 
these evils, together with the merits of the most blessed 
Mother of God and of all the saints. Then we should 
beg that God, for the honor of His holy name and for the 
salvation of souls, would raise up great saints on the earth, 
who are so much needed in these times of spiritual dark 
ness, these last days of the world, as very likely they are. 
St. Teresa says, that the petition "Thy kingdom come" 
follows very naturally from the preceding one, since a 
father s kingdom belongs to his children. "Say, then," 
she continues, "to your heavenly Father: S ince the 
world, the devil, and the flesh reign upon earth, do Thou 
reign over us as our King, and destroy in our souls these 
kingdoms of avarice, pride, and sensuality. " In this 
petition we address Him as our King, and beg Him to 
reign over us, and set up His kingdom in our souls. How 
many aspirations may we not make to that effect, and 
how much time may we not spend upon this petition! 
But this is not all; for we beg and pray Him in this peti 
tion to establish His kingdom in other souls also, that 
all men may love Him. And we also pray that the king 
doms of the world may recognize the principles of religion 
and truth and justice, and the nations become truly 
Christian. Also that God s kingdom, which is the 
Catholic Church, may be triumphant in the world, the 
Vicar of Christ delivered from his enemies, and all people 
recognize the Catholic religion as the one true faith. 
Thus we may make this petition a prayer of intercession 
for the whole world. Again we pray in this place that 
God would give us His kingdom, that is, the kingdom of 
heaven thus praying for our everlasting salvation, and 
that of our neighbor. And finally we pray for His second 



154 -A Talk about Prayer. 

coming, when "The kingdoms of the world shall become 
the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ, and He shall 
reign forever and ever; " when all wrongs shall be righted, 
and all justice done, and the proud shall be cast down, 
and the meek shall inherit the kingdom, and Satan and 
his ministers shall be chained in everlasting darkness; 
"when God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes; 
and death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, 
nor any more sorrow, for the former things are passed 
away." (Apoc. xxi. 4.) Behold all the matter of prayer 
contained in this one petition. Well might we spend 
upon it the whole time of our prayer. 

Next follows the petition, "Thy will be done on earth, 
as it is in heaven." And here we speak to Our Lord as 
to a spouse : for while respect and veneration are owed 
to the name of Father, and between a king and his sub 
jects there is the interchange of commands and obedi 
ence, so, between two who are so closely united as two 
spouses, there is an interchange of wills, each being 
desirous to do the will of the other. For all that one 
has is the other s, and their affairs are in common. So 
Our Lord makes all He has ours and all He desires is 
that we should make all that is ours His; and when there 
are common interests, there should be one will. He 
desires us to give Him our will ; and when we have done 
so, and sincerely desire and do His will, He, in return, 
does our will, and all that we ask of Him He grants us; 
so that, as St. Teresa says, Our Lord is pleased that thus 
He and the faithful soul should command by turns, as it 
were the soul doing His will, and He doing hers. In 
His kingdom in heaven His will is perfectly done; so it 
is no more than right, if we desire His kingdom to be on 
earth (as we have asked in the former petition), that His 
will should be done in this kingdom as in the other. 
Here, then, you can earnestly pray for this perfect con 
formity of your will with His will; in this conformity 
consists all perfection. 



A Talk abotit Prayer. 55 

In the next petition we ask Him to " Give us this day 
our daily bread." Those who have given themselves up 
to God in an interior life, and have cast themselves upon 
His providence, have no need to importune their divine 
Master to give them their earthly bread for their bodily 
support, for as they have forsaken the love of the world 
for Him, He will provide for them, as He is in a manner 
bound to do. So, in this petition, we beg for our spir 
itual necessities. 

Pray here for all the graces you need, for strength to 
support you in temptation, for light to know the will of 
Our Lord, since we can not do His will, as we have asked 
that it might be done, without the assistance and light 
of the Holy Ghost. Also, when you are overburdened 
with grief, or temptations, or other trials, it is right you 
should pray for relief, as far as relief is needful for you ; 
and in times of long-continued dryness, it is not wrong 
for you humbly to ask a little of the bread of consolation, 
if it be Our Lord s will. But this petition may, in a 
special manner, be applied to the Blessed Sacrament, in 
which Our Lord Himself becomes our daily or super- 
substantial bread; and we can turn this clause into a 
contemplation upon the real presence, and holy com 
munion. 

As to the rest of the petitions of the Lord s Prayer, 
what has already been said of the first four is sufficient 
to show how the devout soul may occupy her time with 
each of the others. It is enough to say that in the peti 
tion, "Forgive us our trespasses," special consideration 
should be given to the second clause "As we forgive 
those who trespass against us." For here we can make 
acts of patience under annoyances, of ready forgiveness 
of all injuries, offer ourselves to be ill-treated, humiliated, 
and insulted, and pray for the spirit of meekness. Here, 
lso, in this connection, we can bring in the sacred Pas 
sion of Our Lord, and consider the meekness and patient 
love with which He endured so many outrages; and so, 



56 A Talk about Prayer. 

thinking upon this petition can set us to meditating or 
the Passion of Christ. The next petition, "Lead us not 
into temptation," refers especially to the temptations, 
wiles, and machinations of the devil; and the last peti 
tion refers, not only to temporal and spiritual evils, from 
which we ask to be delivered, but also to this life of exile, 
from which the devout soul may beg to be set free, if it 
be God s will, in order to enter upon the possession of 
her heavenly kingdom, which is the kingdom of her 
Spouse. 

This method of prayer may be applied to the Hail 
Mary, and, indeed, to any other prayer, though no prayer 
will be found to contain so much as this divine prayer of 
Our Lord. The Lord s Prayer, used in this manner, 
may also be applied to any subject that you may take 
up for meditation; as, if the meditation is on any particu 
lar virtue, this prayer may be made to refer to that virtue; 
if on the nativity, our Father, King, and Spouse may be 
represented as present in our souls as an infant, while we 
use the different petitions, as above pointed out. If the 
subject be the Passion, then we may represent Our Lord 
present to our souls as suffering and abandoned by all, 
and so on. 

* A few words about the ordinary method of medita 
tion. Though it is best for those who are accustomed 
to meditate according to the usual formal method to 
stick to the subject they have chosen, yet great latitude 
should be allowed one s self as to the way of developing 
the points, and full liberty also to stop upon any point, 
or to dwell upon any affection that may arise, as long as 
the soul is drawn to do so, or finds any satisfaction in it, 
so that, if, during the whole time of meditation, you do 
not advance beyond the first point, the object of the medi 
tation will be gained; for the consideration of the sub 
ject and the reasoning over the points are designed to 
rouse affections and movements of the will towards God, 
and when that happens, it would be a mistake to smother 



A 2 alk about Prayer. 5 7 

these ascensions of the heart and will toward God, in 
order to go on and begin to reason upon another point. 
Indeed, if the soul is thus roused at the commencement, 
when the picture of the mystery is proposed to the imag 
ination, she should stop there, until her affections begin 
to flag, when she can go on further. You need have no 
fear of being unfaithful by following this rule. 

Another thing. Sometimes it so happens that both 
the imagination and reason seem to be paralyzed, so 
that after faithfully trying to begin and go on with the 
meditation for a little while, the soul finds itself so stupid 
and dull, as to be able to imagine or reason upon noth 
ing. Let her not be discouraged. Let her make simple 
acts of the ivill, however hard and dry they may seem to 
be. Let her spend the time saying to God such things 
as, "O my God, I love you. O my God, I offer my 
mind and body to you; take me. O my God, I give my 
will up to your will I submit to this dryness and dulness " 
and other such simple, dry acts. There may be no 
sensible fervor in them, they may seem to the soul per 
fectly stupid: yet such acts of the will, done, at the same 
time, with great calmness and interior stillness, without 
-hurry or anxiety, will be of the greatest value to the soul 
in the eyes of God. You will make more progress dur 
ing that hour, than in many others when the reason was 
bright and the affections came gushing forth like a foun 
tain. But perhaps the heart may be so dull that even 
these simple acts can not be made without turmoil and 
disturbance of mind. In that case, remain quietly before 
God in perfect calmness, submitting yourself to His will 
in this. Occupy yourself simply in keeping peace. 

Another thing is, to make all your spiritual exercises 
daily or otherwise, whatever manner of prayer you may 
be using, with the greatest peace, calmness, and still 
ness of heart. There is nothing worse in prayer than 
anxiety, fear, fretfulness, hurry, over-eagerness to do it 
right, or any overstraining of the soul. All should be 



58 Vocal Prayer. 

done with the greatest calmness, stillness, peace, and 
tranquillity possible. The loss of that interior calmness 
disturbs recollection, distracts the attention, and hinders 
the workings of the Holy Spirit. So that, if your tran 
quillity is disturbed, you must endeavor by all means to 
restore it before you go further, even though the whole 
time of your prayer be occupied in doing this. 

Another way of practising interior prayer is to tak? 
some devout book, read a little in it, and then reflect upon 
what has been read, and make acts of the will and affec 
tions upon it. When the mind grows a little weary 
take the book up again, and read a little more, and so on, 
The same can be done with any vocal prayer, as explained 
above. In this way we turn vocal prayer into mental. 

When the time for ending the meditation is come, it 
should not be prolonged because the soul is dissatisfied 
with its success. That would bring on weariness and 
scruples. W r hen something happens that the prayer 
must be curtailed or even omitted, let it be done with 
liberty and without scruple; only not out of a spirit of 
sloth or disgust. For the rest of your time, endeavor to 
keep quietly and gently recollected in God. 



Docal 

VOCAL prayer is prayer recited with the lips, and 
usually according to some certain formula. Al 
though in itself vocal prayer is not so excellent as mental 
prayer, we should, nevertheless, beware of underrating 
its usefulness or necessity. All true Christians fre 
quently recite vocal prayers, such as the Our Father, 
the Hail Mary, the Apostles Creed, the acts of faith, 
hope, charity, and contrition. The Church prescribes 
vocal prayer very strictly to her priests and her Religious 

* From Father Girardey s "Instructions on Prayer." 



Vocal Prayer. 5 9 

,n the Mass, in the liturgy, and in the divine office. She 
has enriched many vocal prayers with numerous indul 
gences, and has approved of many prayer-books filled 
with prayers suited to every want and devotion. Vocal 
prayer, then, is both useful and necessary for all men 
without exception even for those who are soaring in 
the heights of contemplation. In reciting vocal prayers, 
we should strive to attend to the meaning of the words, 
appropriating it to ourselves with all, possible fervor and 
earnestness. A few short vocal prayers well said are far 
more acceptable to God than a great many long ones 
recited without attention or fervor. 

One of the best forms of vocal prayer is the frequent 
recitation during the day of some favorite aspiration or 
ejaculatory prayer, especially if we do so in time of trial 
and temptation. This commendable practice gradually 
imparts a habit of recollection, and renders all other 
prayers comparatively easy and free from distraction. 
We should, as far as practicable, prefer reciting those 
vocal prayers which the Church has enriched with indul 
gences, for we thereby gain a twofold advantage the 
benefit of the beautiful and devout prayers themselves, 
and the indulgences, which help us to acquit ourselves 
of the great temporal debt which we have contracted 
towards the divine justice on account of our numerous 
sins. Or we may also apply said indulgences, when so 
applicable, to the souls in purgatory, who will be relieved 
thereby and will not fail to intercede for us in our wants. 

It would be well to join, to a certain extent, mental 
prayer with our vocal prayers, for the merit of the latter 
would be thereby greatly increased. We may do so in 
this wise. During the recitation of our vocal prayers 
we pause at short intervals to reflect either on their mean 
ing or on some supernatural truth; or, without at all 
pausing, we reflect thereon while actually pronouncing 
the prayers with our lips. The rosary is the most com 
mon and readily understood example of this manner of 



60 Mental Prayer. 

praying. While we are reciting the Our Father and the 
Hail Marys of each decade of the rosary, we meditate 
or reflect on some mystery connected with the life of 
Jesus Christ or of His blessed Mother. 

It is also useful, in using the prayers of our prayer- 
book, to read them slowly and deliberately, making in 
the meantime practical reflections on their contents, or 
pausing from time to time to meditate a little and apply 
the words of the prayers to our own wants. If we accus 
tom ourselves to recite our vocal prayers in this way, we 
shall not only make them our own and pray well, but 
we shall also gradually acquire the habit of making 
mental prayer, which tends to unite us more closely to 
God, and, through the practical imitation of our divine 
Saviour s virtues, to render us conformable to Him. 



/IDental prater. 

is called by St. Gregory Nazianzen a 
conference, or conversation with God. St. John 
Chrysostom speaks of prayer as a discourse w r ith the 
divine majesty. According to St. Augustine it is the 
raising up of the soul to God. St. Francis de Sales de 
scribes it as a conversation of the soul with God, by which 
we aspire to Him and breathe in Him, and He, in return, 
inspires us and breathes on us. 

Father Bertrand Wilberforce, in his tract on *Menta? 
Prayer, " writes: 

All prayer is the speaking of the soul to God. This 
may be done in three ways. For the prayer may be either 
in thought only, unexpressed in any external way, or on 
the other hand the secret thoughts and feelings of the soul 
may be clothed in words; and these words, again, may 
either be confined to a set form, or they may be words 
of our own, unfettered by any form, and express ng the 
emotions of our soul at the moment. In the first case 



Mental Prayer, 6 1 

our prayer will be purely mental; in the second, in which 
we employ a set form of words, it will be vocal prayer ; in 
the third case, where the prayer is chiefly in thought, 
but these thoughts are allowed to break forth into words 
in any way that at the moment seem best to express the 
feelings of the soul, it is a mixture of mental and vocal 
prayer, but as the words are spontaneous and not in any 
prescribed form, it may justly be considered as mental 
prayer. 

In an audience with the Pope, we might read a written 
address to his Holiness, or we might trust to the words 
that might occur at the moment, to express what we de 
sired to convey to his mind. But if God were to enable 
the Pope to read the thoughts of our mind, we might 
then simply stand silent in his presence, and he would 
see all that we wanted to express. The formal address 
would be vocal prayer, the silent standing before his 
throne would be purely mental prayer, the conversa 
tion with unprepared words would be a mixture of the 
two, and might be called mental prayer in a more gen 
eral and extended sense. God knows our secret thoughts 
more clearly than we can express them, more certainly 
than we ourselves can know them, and words therefore 
are not necessary in our intercourse with Him, though 
often a considerable help to us. 

A set form of words spoken, or read, can not be called 
prayer at all, unless the mind intends it as prayer, and 
gives some kind of spiritual attention, either to the actual 
sense of the words themselves, or to God Himself while 
they are being uttered. Shakespeare spoke as a theo 
logian when, in Hamlet, he put into the mouth of the king, 
who asked for pardon without repentance: 

My words go up, my thoughts remain below, 
Words without thoughts never to heaven go. 

God condemned the merely material homage of the 
Jews by declaring, "This people honoreth Me with their 



6 2 JMental Pra ver. 

lips, but their heart is far from Me." All prayer, there 
fore, of whatever kind, must be "in spirit and in truth" 
(John iv. 23), but vocal prayer is confined to a prescribed 
form of words, whereas mental prayer is the spontaneous 
utterance of the soul either with or without words. When 
St. Francis said an Our Father, or recited his office, he 
used vocal prayer; when he knelt before God without a 
word his prayer was purely mental; when he spent the 
whole night in saying "Aly God and my all," his mental 
prayer was mingled with words which expressed the burn 
ing love of his seraphic soul. 

St. Alphonsus says, "He who neglects meditation (a 
part of mental prayer), and is distracted by the affairs of 
the world, will not know his spiritual wants, the dangers 
to which his salvation is exposed, the means he ought to 
take to conquer temptations, and will forget the necessity 
of the prayer of petition for all men; thus he will not ask 
for what is necessary, and by not asking God s grace, he 
will certainly lose his soul." 

In the same way St. Teresa asks: "How can charity 
last, unless God gives perseverance ? How will the Lord 
gives us perseverance if we neglect to ask Him for it? 
And how shall we ask it without mental prayer ? With 
out mental prayer there is not the communication with 
God, which is necessary for the preservation of virtue." 
The holy Doctors agree that those who persevere in 
mental prayer will live in God s grace. The following 
words are the deliberate sentence of the holy Doctor St. 
Alphonsus, the conclusion gathered from his vast learn 
ing and experience: "Many say the Rosary, the Office 
of Our Lady, and perform other acts of devotion, but 
they still continue in sin. But it is impossible for him 
u ho perseveres in mental prayer to continue in sin; he will 
either give up mental prayer, or renounce sin. Mental 
prayer and sin can not exist together. And this we see 
by experience ; they who make mental prayer, rarely fall 
into mortal sin ; and should they have the misery of fall- 



Is Mental Prayer Easy ? 63 

ing into sin, by persevering in mental prayer, they see 
their misery, and return to God. Let a soul, says St. 
Teresa, be ever so negligent, if she perseveres in mental 
prayer, the Lord will bring her back to the haven of sal 
vation." 

If this were merely the opinion of St. Alphonsus him 
self it would be of immense weight, considering his re 
splendent sanctity, his vast spiritual learning, and the 
varied experience of his long and active life, but besides 
this the holy Doctor is here only summing up, in one sen 
tence, the teaching and experience of all the doctors, 
saints, writers, preachers, and confessors of the whole 
Church since the beginning. What stronger argument 
could be used to prove the importance and necessity of 
mental prayer? 



fls /IDental jpra^er 

NY one who has a real desire to be saved, and who 
believes that the opinion of St. Alphonsus, and 
all other spiritual teachers, that mortal sin and mental 
prayer can not live together, but are mutually destruc 
tive, is really true, must feel a desire to adopt so certain 
a means of salvation. But many are faint-hearted, and 
dread the little difficulty they feel in beginning a new 
exercise, and many more lack the courage and self-denial 
necessary to continue in it after the novelty has worn 
away, and the yoke of perseverance begins to gall. Blessed 
are they who courageously persevere, for their salvation 
is secure! 

Those who find it difficult to begin, or are tempted to 
abandon this powerful means of salvation, must pluck 
up heart, and encourage themselves by remembering 
that mental prayer requires no learning, no special power 
of mind, no extraordinary grace, but only a resolute will 
and a desire to please God. In fact the hard matter is 



64 -ft Mental Prayer Easy? 

to convince people how easy and simple a matter mental 
prayer really is, and how the difficulty is far more imag 
inary than real. This difficulty often rises from not hav 
ing grasped the true idea of what is meant by mental 
prayer, and the false idea of the exercise once formed, is 
often never corrected, the consequence being that the 
practice is either abandoned in disgust, or persevered in 
with extreme repugnance, and little fruit. 

One common cause of misunderstanding, perhaps the 
most common of all, is the custom of calling the whole 
exercise by the name of one subordinate and not most 
important part, that is meditation. From this, the idea 
arises that it is a prolonged spiritual study, drawn out at 
length with many divisions and much complicated process, 
and this notion frightens many good souls, and makes 
them fall back on vocal prayer alone. They imagine 
that the soul must preach a discourse to itself, and they 
feel no talent for preaching. Many, if they spoke their 
minds clearly, would say, "I can not meditate, but if I 
might be allowed to pray during that time instead, I 
could do very well!" This is no imaginary case, as any 
one who has had any experience will testify, and this 
miserable misunderstanding that so often holds souls 
back for years, is partly brought about by defective teach 
ing, but partly also by the name meditation being used, 
instead of the more comprehensive one of mental prayer. 

Mental prayer properly understood, will be found to 
be easy and within the power of all who desire salvation. 
Of course there are many degrees of prayer, and to pray 
perfectly is no doubt a matter of great difficulty, but to 
pray well and in a way very pleasing to God, and very 
profitable to the soul, is an easy and simple matter. If 
we remember how many thousands have excelled in 
mental prayer though not even able to read, we shall see 
that this holy exercise can not require any special power 
of mind or any degree of culture. St. Isidore, a farm 
laborer, is an example of a man utterly devoid of human 



Is Menial Prayer Easyf 65 

learning, but rising, by God s grace, to the sublimest 
prayer. 

In order to pray with fruit and without distraction, it 
is very useful and in most cases necessary, to spend some 
time in meditation or pious thought on some definite 
subject, and from this fact, as before stated, the whole 
exercise is often called meditation, instead of mental 
prayer. This often misleads people into imagining that 
meditation, that is, the use of the intellect in thinking on 
a holy subject, is the main end to be aimed at, whereas in 
fact it is only a means to the end, which is prayer or con 
versation with God. Meditation furnishes us with the 
matter for conversation, but it is not itself prayer at all. 
When thinking and reflecting the soul speaks to itself, 
reasons with itself; in prayer it speaks to God. 

Meditation in its wide sense is any kind of attentive 
and repeated thought upon any subject and with any 
intention, but in the more restricted sense in which it is 
understood as a part of mental prayer, it is, as St. Francis 
de Sales puts it, "an attentive thought, voluntarily re 
peated or entertained in the mind, to excite the will to 
holy and salutary reflections and resolutions." It differs 
from mere study in its object: we study to improve oui 
minds and to store up information, we meditate to move 
the will to pray and to embrace good. We study that w 
may know, we meditate that we may pray. 

We must then use the mind in thus thinking or ponder 
ing on a sacred subject for a few minutes, and in order tc 
help the mind in this exercise, we must have some defi 
nite subject of thought upon which it is well to read either 
a text of Holy Scripture or a few lines out of some other 
holy book. St. Teresa tells us that she thus helped her 
self with a book for seventeen years. By this short read 
ing, the mind is rendered attentive and is set on a train 
of thought. Further to help the mind you can ask your 
self some such questions as the following: What does 
this mean ? What lesson does it teach me ? What have 



b6 Is Menial Prayer Easy/ 1 

I done about this in the past ? What shall I now do, and 
how? 

Two remarks are here most important. The first is, 
that care must be taken not to read too much, but to stop 
when any thought strikes the mind. If the reading is 
prolonged, if, for example, in a short prayer of half an 
hour you were to read for ten minutes, the exercise would 
be changed into spiritual reading. The second remark 
is, that you must not be distressed if you find the mind 
torpid, and if only one or two very simple thoughts pre 
sent themselves. It is by no means necessary to have 
many thoughts, or to indulge in deep and well arranged 
reflections. The object of mental prayer is not to preach 
a well prepared and eloquent sermon to yourself: the 
object is to pray. If one simple thought makes you pray, 
why distress yourself because you have not other and 
more elaborate thoughts? If you wanted to reach the 
top of a roof you would not trouble yourself because your 
ladder was a short one, provided it was long enough to 
land you safely on the roof. The end is gained. If one 
simple reflection enables you to pray, you would, in 
reality, be merely distracting yourself from prayer in 
order to occupy yourself with your own thoughts, if you 
were to go on developing a lengthy train of thought. 
This would be to mistake the means for the end, and 
it is a very common mistake and the cause of great 
discouragement. This mistake will be evident if you 
remember that while you are following out a line of 
thought, for instance, when you are answering the ques 
tions suggested above, you are conversing with your 
self. 

It is plain therefore that as your object is to converse 
with God, you should not remain too long in talking to 
yourself, and that, therefore, if you feel a difficulty in 
doing this, you need not be distressed. "The progress 
of a soul," says the enlightened St. Teresa, "does not 
consist in thinking much of God, but in loving Him 



Is Menial Prayer Easy ? 67 

ardently; and this love is gained by resolving to do a 
great deal for Him." 

I have said that misunderstanding this point is the 
most fruitful source of discouragement, and one of the 
commonest reasons for abandoning mental prayer in 
disgust, and the reason is, because very few people are 
accustomed to prolonged or deep thought on any subject. 
Few indeed are capable of it. If, therefore, they imagine 
that prolonged, if not deep thought, is necessary for 
mental prayer, they are in constant trouble and discour 
agement, which ends in their abandoning the whole exer 
cise in despair. "If I might only be allowed to pray," 
they will sigh to themselves, "how much easier it would 
be! " 

Let such persons then clearly understand, that many 
thoughts are not necessary, that their reflections need 
not be deep and ought not, especially in a prayer of half 
an hour, to be long, lest prayer should be neglected and 
the exercise be changed into a study. "Meditation," 
says St. Alphonsus, "is the needle, which only passes 
through that it may draw after it the golden thread, which 
is composed of affections, petitions, and resolutions." 
The needle is only used in order to draw the thread after 
it. If then you were to meditate for an hour, and think 
out a subject in all its details, but without constant acts 
and petitions, you would be working hard with an un 
threaded needle. 

Men s minds differ as much as their features, and some 
men, especially those employed in very distracting duties, 
need more thought before they can pray than others, but 
many, especially women, will find that the effort, after 
prolonged reflections, will generally defeat itself and end 
in distraction. 

As soon, therefore, as you feel an impulse to pray, give 
way to it at once in the best way you can by acts and 
petitions, in other words, begin your conversation with 
God on the subject about which you have been think 



68 Is Mental Prayer Easy r&amp;gt; 

ing. Do not imagine, moreover, that it is necessary to 
wait for a great fire to burn up in your soul, but cherish 
the little spark that you have got. Above all, never give 
way to the mistaken notion that you must restrain your 
self from prayer in order to go through all the thoughts 
suggested by your book, or because your prayer does 
not appear to have a close connection with the subject 
of your meditation. This would simply be to turn from 
God to your own thoughts or to those of some other man. 

To meditate means in general nothing else than to 
reflect seriously on some subject. Meditation, as men 
tal prayer, is a serious reflection on some religious truth 
or event, united with reference and application to our 
selves, in order thereby to excite in us certain pious sen 
timents such as contrition, humility, faith, hope, charity, 
etc. and to move our will to form good resolutions con 
formable to these pious sentiments. Such an exercise 
has naturally a beneficial influence on our soul and greatly 
conduces to enlighten our mind and to move our will to 
practise virtue. 

"Meditation," writes Madame Cecilia, in her admir 
able work "At the Feet of Jesus," " consists in occupying 
ourselves mentally and prayerfully with some mystery of 
the faith. We call to mind the chief facts, ponder over 
them, and then stir up our will to regulate our conduct 
in consequence. Hence, meditation is an exercise of 
the faculties of our soul memory, understanding, and 
will. Some persons are also aided by the imagination; 
to others it is a hindrance. Do you complain that you 
can not meditate? Well, let me ask you: Have you 
ever received an affront that cut you to the quick ? Then, 
perhaps, you did meditate; you thought over it for an 
hour or more. Memory recalled the facts, imagination 
supplied extra details and coloring, the intelligence dis 
cussed the motives, such as ingratitude, jealousy, pride; 
it considered the baseness and the unexpectedness of the 
insult; finally, the "will took a firm resolution to avoid 



Method of Meditation According to St. Ignatius. 69 

that person. Now, what was all this but a meditation 
in which you employed all the powers of your soul? 
Moreover, it was probably made without a single dis 
traction, which is of very rare occurrence when we medi 
tate on a mystery of our holy faith. 

"Unfortunately, the subject was not well chosen, but 
at least it may help you to understand that you are ca 
pable of making a meditation. Suppose that, instead of 
reflecting on a personal affront, you had chosen for sub 
ject the insults received by Our Lord at the court of 
Herod. You pictured out the scene, recalled the facts, 
pondered them over, weighed the motives, and then 
stirred up yourself to imitate your divine model. This 
would have been an excellent meditation. Now it is 
true that the Holy Ghost is the great Master Who 
teaches us how to pray, but this does not dispense us 
from means which He has placed at our disposal, for 
God helps those who help themselves, in this as in 
temporal enterprises. The masters of the spiritual life 
have traced out methods of mental prayer for their dis 
ciples. The one laid down by St. Ignatius, in his Spir 
itual Exercises, is perhaps the best known." 

It consists of three parts: (i) preparation, (2) medi 
tation proper, (3) exercise of the affections. Each of 
these parts is subdivided, and a few words on them 
may be useful to the reader. 



/ifcetboo of /IDeoitatfon Bccorotns to St. 
flcjnatius. 

I. PREPARATION. 

EAD over the subject of the meditation carefully. 
This can be done the previous evening. Place 
yourself in the presence of God; stand (if convenient) 
and reflect on the truth that God sees into your inmost 



70 Method of Meditation According to St. Ignatius. 

soul; kneel and make an act of faith and an act of adora 
tion with all the intensity of your inmost being. 

As to the remote preparation: Having read the sub 
ject of the meditation over night, reflect what fruit you 
may gather from it, considering the actual need of your 
soul. When in bed, dwell on no thought which might 
distract you from the subject of the meditation. 

When you awake in the morning, after some appro 
priate ejaculatory prayers, and after offering to God your 
heart and your actions, banish every other thought; re 
flect before Whom you are about to appear, and try to 
excite in yourself some affection, analogous to the fruit 
which you desire to gather from the meditation. 

The acts of faith and adoration need not occupy much 
time. They have for object to prepare you by devout 
recollection to commune with God. They form the 
immediate preparation, together with the preludes. 

ist Prelude. This is an exercise of the imagination 
which you can omit if you do not find it helpful. Pic 
ture to yourself some scene connected with the mystery 
which forms the subject of your meditation, i.e., form 
your composition 0} place. 

2d Prelude. Ask for a grace in keeping with the 
mystery on which you intend to meditate. Thus, if you 
have chosen the Passion of Our Lord, pray for a deep 
hatred of sin or perfect contrition. 

II. THE MEDITATION PROPER. 

Having called to mind very vividly, by acts of faith 
and adoration, that you are in the presence of God; 
having made your preparatory prayer; having formed 
your composition of place, if desirable, by means of the 
imagination, and having finished your preludes, you pro 
ceed to the meditation proper, namely, to the second 
part. 

Here we consider the subject carefully and devoutly. 
If you have for subject some maxim of Our Lord, think 



Method of Meditation According to St. Ignatius. 71 

when, where, and why He uttered it. See what lesson 
you can learn from it, and how far your conduct is at 
variance with the precept. Take a practical resolution 
to amend. Determine some definite act of virtue in 
question. A vague purpose of amendment is useless. 

In this part of the meditation, avoid spending all the 
time in reflections, since they are a means, not an end. 
Their great object is to stir up your will to do some good 
action, and to serve as solid foundation for your reso 
lutions. The most important part of meditation is the 
exercise of the affections, and all the preceding steps 
should lead up to this essential point. 

As Father Chaignon, S J., says in his " Sacerdotal 
Meditations ;" " Prayer is a gift of the Spirit of God ; it is 
a. science of which this Holy Spirit is the first, or rather 
the only, veritable Master. Let us earnestly pray to Him 
to grant us this gift, which shall be for us the channel of 
the most precious graces. Let us learn of Him this 
science, which is so important a part of the science of the 

saints." 

Domine, doce nos orare. (Luke i. n.) He teaches it, 
says St. Bernard, in acting upon our memory, our in 
tellect, and our will. Monet, et docet, et movet; monet 
memoriam, docet rationem, movet voluntatem : sugge- 
rendo, instruendo, afficiendo. (St. Bernard, Serm. de 
Pent.). One could not have more clearly designated 
the exercises of the three faculties, in which the method of 
St. Ignatius precisely consists. 

A. The Memory: Propose to yourself the whole sub 
ject of the meditation; place before yourself the whole 
of the truth or mystery under consideration, as if you 
were relating or describing it to another person very 
clearly and briefly. An act of faith will help you. 

B. The Intellect or Understanding : It first considers 
the truth and then makes the application. 

i. Consider what you have to believe, or do, with re 
spect to the truth which vou have proposed to yourself; 



7 2 Method of Meditation According to St. Ignatius. 

what lesson for the amendment of your life you will fi&amp;d 
in this truth, or in this mystery. Search for it, and as 
soon as you have arrested it, you will pass on. to the con 
sideration of some motives, which may move your heart 
and engage you to put it in practice. 

2. Examine also very carefully how much you esteem 
a truth so important for your salvation as that which 
engages your attention ; whether you are in the habit of 
regulating your conduct by what it inculcates, or whether 
you are negligent with regard to it. Admit your negli 
gence; acknowledge your faults. What is the cause of 
your errors? What means will you employ to avoid 
them? 

C. The Will : 

1. Pious affections are aroused. These affections 
differ as the subject varies, or in accordance with the 
dispositions of the soul and the motions of the Holy Spirit 
confusion, shame, and contrition; distrust of ourselves; 
confidence in God; thanksgiving; offering of ourselves; 
sacrifice of ivlmtever obstructs or retards perfection; resig 
nation; abandonment to the will of God. 

2. The will makes strong resolutions, with regard to 
a certain virtue, for instance, humility, or, with regard 
to certain occasions and certain means, tending to greatei 
perfection. 

3. You will make some colloquies, especially toward 
the end of the meditation. 

III. COLLOQUY. 

This is a direct prayer; so make acts of faith, hope, 
charity, etc., as they are suggested by the subject of your 
meditation. This part of the meditation should occupy 
perhaps one-fifth of the whole time alloted to the exercise. 

The colloquy may also be called a familiar and re 
spectful address to God, in which we praise Him, thank 
Him, beg His pardon, ask Him for some grace, some- 



Method of Meditation According to St. Ignatius. 73 

times as His child, sometimes as His servant or spouse. 
In the colloquies we may also address ourselves to Jesus 
Christ, the Blessed V irgin, or the saints. 



RESOLUTIONS AND SPIRITUAL BOUQUET AFTER 
MEDITATION. 

Finish with the offering of resolutions. You can use 
a set form, or your own words. Then, as a reminder of 
your meditation, choose a "spiritual bouquet," that is, 
some thought which bears on the subject and which 
you can recall when tempted to break your resolution. 

Finally, recite some vocal prayer, such as the Our 
Father, Hail Mary, or the Anima Chris ti. This is a 
brief exposition of the Ignatian method. 

Remember that there are times of spiritual desolation, 
when mental prayer or meditation is very difficult. This 
is not a reason for neglecting or curtailing your medita 
tion. Try to fix your attention and say some vocal 
prayers to obtain the grace you desire; humble yourself 
before God; do not be discouraged. God asks for your 
efforts; the success does not depend entirely on you. 

When you find sufficient food for reflection and affec 
tions in one point, do not be in a hurry to pass on to the 
next. 

Do not adhere slavishly to the thoughts suggested in 
the colloquies; those that come to you naturally are far. 
more helpful. Speak to God with respectful familiarity. 

In choosing your resolution, base it on some well 
grounded motive; endeavor to foresee when and how 
you can put it into practice.*

Explanation of tbe Sulpician /IDetbofc ot 
/IDental prater. 

Very Rev. A. Magnien, S.S., D.D., former 
Superior of the Theological Seminary of St. Sul- 
pice, Baltimore, in his introduction to Father Ha- 
mon s "Meditations," writes: 

This work is based upon the Method of Mental 
Prayer, which is followed in all Sulpician seminaries 
and in many other religious communities throughout the 
world. This method is extremely logical and as simple 
as it is logical. 

Many, however, have been trained in the Ignatian 
method, and do not readily take to any other. 

The Sulpician method of meditation consists essen 
tially of three parts, the first of which is called the Prep 
aration, the second the Body of the Prayer, and the third 
the Conclusion. We shall devote a few words to the 
explanation of each. All spiritual writers presuppose 
in those who practise meditation a preparation known as 
remote. By the very nature of the case, the lives of those 



The Sulpician Method of Mental Prayer. 77 

who aim at perfection should be characterized by detach 
ment from worldly things as such, and by the spirit of 
mortification. The method proper, then, opens with 
the proximate preparation. This should be made on 
the preceding evening and in the morning, continuing 
until the moment we are ready to begin our prayer. In 
its main outlines it is a summary of the whole Meditation, 
and is so styled in Father Hamon s work. After dwell 
ing upon the goodness of God as evidenced in each par 
ticular subject, we consider what we ought to do for Him 
in return, and what means it were best to adopt in view 
of the desired end. The resolutions flow naturally from 
these considerations, and are determined in their char 
acter by them. 

We have now to deal with the Body of the Prayer, 
which in Father Hamon s work falls under the title 
Meditation for the Morning. In the first part, called 
Adoration, we study the subject in our blessed Lord, 
calling to mind His words, His actions, and the spirit of 
His life. The mystery or virtue as seen in Him will in 
duce us to render to Him our duties of adoration, admi 
ration, praise, thanksgiving, love, joy, or compassion, 
according to circumstances. The second part (including 
points i and 2) supplies us with motives and means of 
practising virtue, and suggests, in each case, that we 
reflect upon our conduct in order to see whether, and to 
what extent, we possess the particular virtue recommended. 
Our neglect and consequent failure will inspire us with 
sorrow for the past, confusion for the present, and desire 
for the future. Recognizing that God only can give 
effect to our desires, we earnestly implore Him to grant 
us the virtue upon which we have been meditating. 
That nothing may be wanting to success, we in the third 
part of the Body of the Prayer make definite resolutions 
for the present day, thus insuring our own cooperation. 

What we have termed the Conclusion is made up of 
acts in which we thank God for the graces which He has

bestowed upon us during prayer, and beg His pardon 
for any faults of which we may have been guilty whilst 
holding commune with Him. 

The Spiritual Nosegay is a text taken from the Sacred 
Scriptures, or from the Fathers, or from the Office of 
the Church, which both summarizes and suggests the 
considerations and resolutions of the morning. Those 
who desire more intimate acquaintance with this excel 
lent method will find an admirable exposition of its sev 
eral parts in Father Faber s treatises: " Growth in Holi 
ness" in the chapter on Prayer.

80 Method of Particular Examination. 

/ifcetboo of particular Examination in 
Striving after perfection, 



are two kinds of examination (or examen) 
general and particular. The object of the first is 
to discover all the faults we have committed. 

The second or particular examination has for its 
object one single fault or bad habit, which we have re 
solved to correct. 

It is made every day in the following manner: 

1. In the morning, on rising, resolve to avoid this sin 
or defect. 

2. Toward noon, ask of God the grace to remember 
how often you have fallen into it, and to avoid it for the 
future. Then examine, thinking over the time passed 
since your rising, ascertaining the number of faults 
committed, and marking them by so many points in 
the first line of a table like the following: 



Days 0} the Week.

3. In the evening, after supper, or at nightfall, a new 
examination like the first, marking the faults on the 
second line for the day. 

Observations. 

1. At each fault against the resolutions you have taken, 
as soon as you recollect, yourself, put your hand on your 
heart and repent of your fall. 

This can be done without being observed by any one. 

2. At night, count the points of the two examinations, 
and see if from the first to the second you have made any 
amendment or progress. 

3. Compare in the same way the day or the week, 
which is ending, with the preceding day or week. The 
lines of the record diminish in length, from the ist to the 
7th day, because it is reasonable to expect that the num 
ber of the faults should likewise diminish. 

4. The subject of the particular examen should be 
ordinarily the predominant pagoicn that is, the one 
which is the source of the greater number of faults that 
you commit, and which consequently is the great obstacle 
to your sanctification. 

5. This examination on the predominant passion 
should be continued, until it is entirely overcome, or, at 
least, notably weakened. 

Subject-matter of tbe particular 



V VJ I HAT is the subject-matter of the Particular Ex 
^J^ animation? According to St. Ignatius, it is "thfe 
particular sin or defect," that is, imperfection of any kind, 
"of which one wishes to correct himself." The same idea 



* From " First Lessons in the Science of the Saints," by R. 
Meyer, S.J. 



82 The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 

is conveyed by the words which the priest says at the 
Offertory of the Mass, whe,n he prays : "Accept, O holy 
Father, almighty and everlasting God, this immaculate 
victim which I, Thy unworthy servant, offer Thee for 
my innumerable sins, and offences, and negligences." 

Sins, in this connection, are faults properly so called 
in thought, word, deed, and omission and into which we 
frequently and deliberately fall. Offences are faults less 
properly so called, which we are wont to commit through 
human frailty and inadvertence, just as a traveller walk 
ing upon slipper} ground is apt to fall, when he is ever 
so little off his guard. Negligences are shortcomings 
which can not properly be classed with sins of omission, 
and which do not wholly vitiate our actions, but which 
dim their lustre and mar their perfection. Such, for 
example, are all those shortcomings, which result from 
a lack of fervor, of a pure intention, of full correspond 
ence with the lights and graces vouchsafed us, and of 
other qualities which ought to shine forth in our actions 
and in our whole lives. 

The Particular Examination, therefore, should be 
directed: first, towards avoiding all deliberate sins; 
secondly, towards diminishing the number of our lesser 
offences, and, as far as possible, avoiding them; thirdly, 
towards diminishing the number of our negligences, and, 
as far as possible, avoiding them. In all these cases, there 
is question of amending some fault, whether it be a sin 
strictly so called, or a want of perfect fidelity and cor 
respondence on our part. Hence St. Ignatius very 
properly mentions only sins and defects, as the subject 
matter of the Particular Examination of Conscience, 
yet it is obvious, that we can not avoid those shortcom 
ings called negligences, except by the practice of the 
missing virtue or perfection. For instance, if the negli 
gence consists in the lack of a pure intention in our 
actions, the only way to correct it is to be careful in 
future to have such an intention, and this implies posi- 



The Subjeci-matter of the Particular Examen. 83 

tive acts of virtue. In general, sins or evil habits may 
be overcome, either directly by repressing them, or indi 
rectly by practising the contrary virtues. The former is 
called the negative, and the latter the positive method. 
Both methods are indicated by the. author of the Imi 
tation, when he writes: "Two things particularly con 
duce to a great amendment; these are, forcibly to with 
draw one s self from that to which nature is viciously 
inclined, and earnestly to labor for the good which one 
wants the most." 

But, whether we pursue the negative or the positive 
method, it is essential to full success that the sub 
ject-matter be sharply denned. Not only must we aim 
at the correction of our vice, or the acquisition of 
one virtue at a time, but often we must subdivide the 
matter into several parts, corresponding to the different 
ways in which either the vice or the virtue shows itself. 
For example, if we wish to apply our Particular Exam 
ination to rooting out pride and implanting humility 
in our hearts, it is not sufficient to propose to ourselves 
in general, not to take pride in anything and to humble 
ourselves in everything. Thus proposed, the subject- 
matter is altogether too comprehensive. For pride may 
betray itself in ambitious thoughts, in boastful words, in 
haughty deeds; humility, on the other hand, may mani 
fest itself in lowliness of spirit, in meekness of speech, in 
modesty of demeanor. And each one of these subdi 
visions furnishes ample matter for the Particular Exam 
ination of Conscience. 

So much being presupposed, we may ask: What 
should we take as the subject of our Particular Exam 
ination? To this question no general answer can be 
given. It is a matter which the advice of a prudent con 
fessor or director, aided by the self-knowledge derived 
from prayer and especially from the General Examina 
tion, must determine for each one of us, according to 
circumstances. However, as a guide for the confessor or 



84 The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 

director, as well as for the penitent, spiritual writers lay 
down the following rules: 

1 . Strive to subdue your vice before you apply your 
self to trie acquisition of virtue. "The husbandman 
frees his field from briars, nettles, and noxious weeds, 
before he scatters the good seed over it. In like manner, 
he that tills the soil of his heart, should begin by rooting 
up his vices, and then devote himself to cultivating the 
virtues which will bear fruits of holiness, while at the 
same time they will check the undergrowth of vice." 
The first subject, therefore, of the Particular Examina 
tion should be deliberate sins. Until they have been 
cleared away, we look in vain for a healthy growth of 
virtues. 

2. Correct your external faults before others which are 
purely internal. The latter easily escape the scrutiny 
of one who has little experience in the spiritual life. They 
may not be voluntary, because not all our internal actions 
are under the control of the will; and so it often happens, 
that the beginner is unable to tell how far, if at all, he is 
to blame. Begin, therefore, with external actions, which 
are more easily governed, and more readily recognized 
as culpable, when they deviate from the laws of God and 
of right reason. By thus regulating your external ac 
tions, you will gradually weaken the vices in which they 
have their origin. For instance, if the high opinion 
which you have of yourself, shows itself in haughty or 
boastful words, the effort to check them will make itself 
felt in your heart, and will deaden the sentiment of ego 
tism which finds expression in them. 

3. If you are subject to a, variety of external faults, 
try to free yourself first from such as are more likely to 
give scandal or to detract from the esteem which a life 
of virtue ought to inspire ii\ others. For example, if 
you are accustomed to speak hastily, thoughtlessly, 
sharply, and thereby perhaps wound the feelings or in 
jure the reputation of your neighbor, reason and charity 



The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 85 

requite you to correct these defects before others which, 
in themselves, may be far more serious. 

4. Again, amend your deeds before your words; be 
cause, as St. Ignatius teaches in the General Examina 
tion of Conscience, sins of deed are more serious than 
others, for a threefold reason: namely, "on account 
of the greater length of time, the greater intensity of 
the act, and the greater number scandalized or in 
jured." 

5. Beware, however, of being so intent on the correc 
tion of external faults, as to pass your whole life therein. 
After all, it is not external propriety, but internal purity, 
that we must propose to ourselves as our ultimate aim. 
We are engaged in a conflict with vice, and vice is rooted 
in the heart. 

Find out, therefore, by means of the General Examina 
tion, what is the vice that has the upper hand in you ; in 
other words, find out what is the chief disorder intro 
duced into the soul by your predominant passion. There 
is your danger, there is the spot which your enemy will 
attack, there is the traitor, ready to take sides with him 
and to deliver you into his hands, there is the Goliath, 
whose head you must cut off in order to free yourself 
from the hands of the Philistines. 

If several vices or disorderly passions of different kinds 
hold sway in your soul, see of what nature they are. 
Some vices may be spiritual, because they seem, as it 
were, to spring up from the soul itself. Such a vice is 
pride, with all its varieties of vainglory, ambition, haughti 
ness, disdain, and the like. Other vices, on the contrary, 
are wholly carnal, because they proceed more directly 
from the sinful appetites of the body. Such a vice is 
sensuality under all its forms of impurity, gluttony, 
sloth, and so forth. These carnal vices, if not restrained, 
are a source of great and imminent danger; and, there 
fore, a person who is molested by them should subdue 
them before he undertakes the combat against spiritual 



86 The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 

vices, which may indeed inflict many slight wounds upon 
the soul, but which do not easily kill it. 

6. In case you are not troubled by any vice in par 
ticular, or have so far subdued them that your faults are 
few and light, it is well for you to change from the nega 
tive method to the positive, and to take, as the subject 
of your Particular Examination, the virtue which you 
desire especially to acquire. For though, as already 
stated, the immediate object of the Particular Examina 
tion is the correction of your faults, it is not well to spend 
your whole time in this alone. He that is engaged in 
weeding a garden, is well employed; but it does not fol 
low therefrom that he must never do anything else. On 
the contrary, the object he should have in view in pulling 
up the weeds, is to plant flowers in their place. In like 
manner, when you spend your Particular Examination 
in rooting up the vicious inclinations of your soul, you 
should propose to yourself to plant the sweet-scented 
flowers of virtue in their stead. 

What should move you, above all, to adopt the positive 
method, when your passions rarely rise in open or vio 
lent revolt against reason, is that otherwise you will 
derive little or no profit from your Particular Examina 
tion. In fact, the occasions of combat being rare, you 
are apt to forget the subject altogether and to imagine 
that your enemies have surrendered when they have 
only withdrawn into their stronghold. You fancy, for 
sooth, that you have subdued the passion of anger, be 
cause nothing has occurred to ruffle your temper. But 
you are greatly deceived. It is not astonishing that the 
sea is smooth when there is not a breath of air to dis 
turb the calm. Neither is it astonishing that you are 
quiet, when chere is not a living soul to arouse your 
wrath. Your passions seem to be dead ; but, in reality, 
they are only asleep. Unless you strengthen and arm 
yourself then, while they leave you a little respite, they 
"will assault you all the more violently, when they awake. 



The Subject-mailer of the Particular Examen. 87 

Instead, therefore, of laboring to correct a defect 
which you seldom commit, aim at acquiring the oppo 
site perfection. Do you wish to guard against ever 
treating others with haughtiness or contempt ? Learn 
to look upon yourself as the least of all ; and take, as the 
subject of your Particular Examination, the practice of 
humiliation. Do you wish to make sure of not repining 
when adversity will come to try you? Endeavor to see 
the hand of God in all the occurrences of life; and take, 
as the subject of your Particular Examination, the prac 
tice of perfect conformity to the divine will. Whatever 
virtue you select, let it be genuine, solid, supernatural, 
capable of bearing the stress of trying circumstances 
and of being carried to the highest degree of perfection. 
Let it be the virtue which is most opposed to your pre 
dominant passion, the virtue which you need most in 
your present state and condition of life, or the virtue 
which will unite you most closely to God, the source and 
centre of all holiness and perfection. 

Having thus determined the subject-matter, we per 
form the Particular Examination, together with the 
General Examination, as an adjunct and auxiliary to it. 
That we may do so with the best possible results, St. 
Ignatius, who was the first to reduce the Particular 
Examination to a systematic form and to promote its 
practice throughout the world, gives us some valuable 
directions. "The daily Particular Examination," he 
writes, "embraces three times and two sittings. The 
first time is straightway in the morning on rising, when a 
person resolves to guard diligently against the particular 
sin or defect, which he desires to correct. The second 
time is in the middle of the day, when, after begging 
light to know how often he has offended Almighty God, 
he begins the scrutiny of his conscience, as explained in 
the General Examination, by first demanding an account 
of his soul concerning the particular fault in question . . . 
from the hour at which he rose down to the present. 



88 The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 

Then he marks in a book prepared for the purpose, how 
many times he has fallen; and, when he makes the 
act of contrition and purpose of amendment for his sins, 
he includes, in an especial manner, the particular fault 
in question. 

"The third time is in the evening, when he makes a 
second sifting in like manner ; and, after marking in his 
book, how many times he has fallen, he again says an 
act of contrition and resolves to be more on his guard in 
future, especially against the particular fault in question." 

These practices, and especially that of marking the 
number of one s falls, will perhaps be looked upon by 
some as childish minutiae, calculated only to hamper the 
spirit. But they are not so regarded by those who are 
experienced in the spiritual life. As a proof, it may 
be allowed to refer, in passing, to two eminent ecclesi 
astics, now departed, who were well known to some 
readers of these lines, and who were highly esteemed by 
all that knew them for their sound, practical judgment, 
no less than for their manly virtue. One of these spoke 
of the little book of the Particular Examination, as the 
pass-book, in which we daily note our current account 
with heaven, and which, if faithfully kept to the last, 
we may present with confidence at the judgment-seat of 
God. The other, a much-beloved prelate, who had 
resigned the dignity of office for the lowliness of a relig 
ious life, on perceiving that the hour for the usual exam 
ination of conscience had come, took leave of the friends 
with whorr 1 he was conversing, and, drawing forth from 
his pocket the booklet of his Particular Examination, 
shook it playfully in their faces, with the remark: "For 
me this is very necessary." These words, said with an 
air and tone of earnest conviction, are quite as appli 
cable to all of us as to the speaker. Not that the success 
of the Particular Examination depends essentially upon 
recording, even to the last unit, the exact number of our 
daily failings; but that neglect in marking with becom- 



The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 89 

ing diligence the result of the Examination, gradually 
leads to forgetfulness, if not to complete disuse, of this 
important exercise in a fervent Christian s life. 

The object of this marking of our faults is to fix the 
attention, and to prevent us from relaxing our efforts 
during the course of the day. The same is true also of 
other practices recommended by St. Ignatius, under 
the head of "Four useful additions, for the easier and 
quicker extirpation of any particular sin or defect." 
" The first is, that each time a person falls into that par 
ticular sin or defect, he lay his hand on his breast, and 
grieve for his fault. This he can do even in the presence 
of others, without their perceiving it." 

"The second is, that at night, after making the second 
scrutiny of his conscience, he compare it with the first, 
"and observe if any amendment has taken place." 

"The third is, that he compare the examination of the 
first and second day, and see if there has been any im 
provement." 

"The fourth is, that he compare one week with an 
other, and note if, in the present week, he has improved 
on the preceding." Made in accordance with these 
directions, the Particular Examination can not fail to 
produce the happiest results. "It owes its great effi 
cacy," writes an experienced director of souls, " to these 
three things: first, it divides our enemies, and brings all 
our forces to bear upon one of them at a time; secondly, 
it attacks our disorders and sinful habits at the root; 
thirdly, it keeps us at work all day and calls for the exer 
cise of every power of the soul." And thus it becomes 
the specific for inveterate and radical defects, which 
resist all other means of self-reform. 

Deep-seated and chronic evils, it is true, are not cured 
speedily, nor by the ordinary remedies; but it is also 
true, that no spiritual evils, however obstinate, can 
resist the persevering efforts of a resolute will aided by 
the grace of God. "Let no one then despair," says 



90 The Subject-matter of the Particular Examen. 

St. Basil, "because of his sinful inclination; rather, let 
him bear in mind that, as skilful culture can change 
the qualities of trees and shrubs, so zeal and industry in 
the pursuit of virtue can check and correct all the vicious 
affections of the soul." 

In a similar manner, one of the ancient fathers of the 
desert counselled and encouraged an anchoret, who had 
grown so remiss in the discharge of all his spiritual duties, 
that lukewarmness seemed to have become his normal 
condition; so much so that though moved to lead a life 
more worthy of his calling, he thought his case too des 
perate to begin the work of self-reform. The venerable 
patriarch, desiring to give additional force to his advice, 
put it in the form of a parable, somewhat as follows: "A 
certain man, having a field all overrun with thorns, 
briars, and tares, told his son to stub and clear it. The 
youth, therefore, set out one day to do the work assigned 
him; but immediately upon beholding it, he lost heart, 
threw himself upon the ground, and spent his time in sleep. 
The next day he went out again, and did likewise. 
Questioned at night how he was progressing, he frankly 
confessed that he had not the courage to undertake what 
appeared to him a hopeless task. Whereupon his good 
father reproved him, saying: You do wrong, my son, 
to look upon your work in the gross, as if you had 
to do it all at once. Mark out for yourself, in the 
morning, as much as you can easily do in a day, and 
address yourself with a will to your appointed task. 
Before long you will find that it is not so hopeless as you 
now fancy to yourself. The son followed his father s 
advice, and full soon the whole field was cleared." 

Let us all apply this parable to ourselves, and mark 
out, every morning, a definite amount of work to do in 
the field which our heavenly Father has given us to 
cultivate. Let us daily clear away some of the thorns, 
briars, and tares which overrun it and hinder the growth 
of the good grain. In other words, let us make strenu-

ous and persevering efforts to free our souls from the sins, 
offences, and negligences into which we are wont to fall, 
and which we recognize as the greatest impediment in 
the way of a Christian life. 

With this object in view, let us diligently perform the 
Particular Examination of Conscience. It is a most 
efficacious means of self-amendment and spiritual prog 
ress. For it is a combat carried on against our faults, 
until the vices from which they spring have been sub 
dued and replaced by the opposite virtues; and, as the 
pious author of the Imitation assures us, "if every year 
we rooted out one vice, we should soon be perfect men."

A PRAYER OF ST. IGNATIUS TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 

C\ BELOVED Word of God, teach me to be generous, 
^"^ to serve Thee with that perfection which Thy 
majesty claims, to give without calculation, to fight with 
out heeding wounds, to labor without repose, to expend 
myself in Thy service without thought of other reward 
than that of knowing that I do Thy most holy will. Amen.

PREPARATORY PRAYER. 



LORD, it is for the purpose of conquering myself 
that by Thy grace I have undertaken these holy 
exercises. It is my rebel will that I desire to vanquish and 



O 



The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 93 

overcome, my unruly and disordered affections which I 
desire to put in order, so that my soul may be attentive 
simply to the seeking and finding of Thy will, and to the 
following of it alone, in the ordering and disposing of my 
life. 

Give me a generous heart, a heart truly liberal, which, 
giving itself to Thee, may abandon itself without any 
reservation to Thee, its Lord and Redeemer. 

Lord, so great to all Thy servants, dispose of my life, 
of my liberty, of all that surrounds me. O my Creator, 
speak to Thy creature. Behold my soul before Thee: 
my will is as a scale in a state of perfectly equal balance, 
which shall only waver to one side or the other when 
Thou placest in it the weight of Thy will or wish. I 
ignore all natural inclination; my will is suspended and 
in a state of perfect indifference. I have but one will 
and desire, to obey and please Thee. I promise Thee 
fidelity to my exercises of piety, and to the full time &amp;lt; s -f 
meditation. I foresee the furious assaults of the devil, 
but I am firmly resolved to yield nothing on this point to 
his importunities. 

1 promise Thee to exert my earnest efforts. It is for 
me to exercise myself, and to labor, even at the cost of 
suffering if necessary; to examine my soul and to rec 
tify its ways; to call on Thee, to listen to Thee, to obey 
Thee. 

I promise Thee to preserve silence; not only shall my 
lips remain silent, but my mind shall be drawn off from 
the cares of life, from the agitations of the world, and 
from all vanities. I know that this interior and exterior 
solitude possesses great merit in Thy sight. But above 
all it leaves me in greater liberty to find that which I so 
ardently desire; it enables me to approach closely to 
Thee, to lose none of Thy words, to be better disposed 
for the receiving of the gifts of Thy divine and supreme 
goodness.

PRAYER TO OBTAIN THE GRACE OF UNDERSTANDING THE 
TRUE END OF MAN. 

/T\AN was created for this end to praise, reverence, 
^ and serve the Lord his God, and by this means 
to arrive at eternal salvation. All other beings or objects 
placed around man on earth have been created for him, 
to serve as means to assist him in the pursuit of the end 
for which he was created. 

We must, then, above all things, endeavor to establish 
in ourselves a complete indifference with regard to all 
created things, even those of which the use is not for 
bidden us; not preferring, as far as depends on us, health 
to sickness, riches to poverty, honor to humiliation, a 
long life to a short one; since good order requires that 
we wish for and choose, in everything, what will lead us 
most surely to the end for which we were created. 

(Text of St. Ignatius.) 

For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world 
and suffer the loss of his soul ? Or what shall a man give 
in exchange for his soul? 

(Mark viii. 36, 37.) 

Jesus said: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy 
whole mind. This is the greatest and the first com 
mandment." 

(Matt. xxii. 37, 38.) 

Jesus said: "The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and 
Him only shalt thou serve." 

(Matt. iv. 10.) 

Lord, Thou hast created me, Thou hast created me for 
Thyself to praise Thee, to reverence Thee, to serve Thee. 
It is by applying myself to Thy service that I shall save 
my soul. All other things placed around me in this world 
are there as so many means whereby I may be conducted 



The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 95 

to the great final end of my creation, which is twofold yet 
one: to serve Thee and save myself. 

Teach me, O Lord, to do my duty, my only duty in 
this world, which is for the fulfilling of Thy intentions 
and designs, to discern amongst Thy creatures ist, those 
which may aid me, so as to use them so long as they may 
be of service to me: 2d, those which may be harmful to 
me, so as to reject them inasmuch as they may be injuri 
ous to me. If I accept some and reject the others, may 
it be solely with the view of glorifying Thee, and of being 
always within the order of Thy will. 

But since my courage may give way, since my heart 
may be fascinated by these extraneous creatures, defend 
it, O my God, and assure to it safety and freedom from 
the seductions of the world. Grant that, indifferent to 
all that is not commanded by Thee, indifferent to all those 
creatures the use of which Thou hast not even forbidden, 
my heart may neither desire nor seek amongst the mul 
tiplicity of creatures and the vicissitudes of life aught but 
what is needful for the fulfilling of Thy will. 

May health or sickness, riches or poverty, honors or 
contempt and humiliations, leave my soul, if not insen 
sible, at least in that state of holy indifference to which I 
desire to attain for Thy greater honor and glory; for 
this I pray. I will and desire that it should be thus with 
me, and I firmly resolve continually to restore my will to 
this necessary equilibrium, so that it may always be 
inclined solely by the motive-power of Thy holy will

PRAYER TO EXCITE ONE S SELF TO REPENTANCE. 

*T* BESEECH Thee, O Lord, to grant me the grace which 
-" I need, and which I earnestly desire to obtain. I ask 
it with confidence, since I know I ought to have a deep 
contrition and abiding and sincere sentiments of sorrow 
for my sins. I ask of Thee that feeling of shame which 



96 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

should make me blush for myself. Many souls have 
been lost by a single mortal sin. How many times have 
I not merited this judgment for my many and great sins 

I ask of Thee an intense sorrow for having committed 
them, tears to weep over them, a broken and contrite 
heart at the memory of them. 

What a sight for me, a sinner, to behold Jesus Christ 
living and in agony on the tree of the cross! O my 
Creator and Redeemer, how great was Thy love when 
Thou didst will to exchange heaven for earth, the glory 
of Thy heavenly life for this life of pain, and to suffer a 
death of infamy for me for my sins. 

Look, O my soul; look at and consider thy past life 
what hast thou done for Jesus Christ in the past at this 
present time what art thou doing for Jesus Christ in 
the future what wilt thou do for Jesus Christ ? Speak, 
O my soul, with Jesus crucified; tell Him thy thoughts, 
tell them to Him with all simplicity; tell them to Him 
just as thou thinkest them. 

Pour out thyself, O my heart, to thy God. Let thy 
thoughts turn from Him to thyself; thy prayer is always 
good and fervent when it is true and sincere, when it 
speaks as a friend speaks to his friend, as a subject 
speaks to his king, as a slave speaks to his master. 
Accuse thyself, O my soul, of the evil thou hast done, 
declare all thy wounds, thy weakness, thy doubts, thy 
waverings, thy most secret thoughts. 

May the Lord, my Creator, cure me and shelter me 
beneath His pardoning grace.

COLLOQUY ON GOD S MERCY AND COMPASSION. 

Thanksgiving 0} the Sinner. 

OLORD God, Thou art infinitely wise, I adore Thee 
Who hast borne with my ignorance; Thou art 
infinitely just, I adore Thee Who hast not chastised my 
iniquity; Thou art infinitely powerful, I adore Thee Who 
hast deigned to spare my weakness ; Thou art infinitely 
good, I adore Thee Who hast pardoned me all my malice 
and sins. 

I thank Thee that the angels, who are the avenging 
swords of Thy justice, have not slain me. I thank Thee 
because the saints, who are Thy friends, have prayed 
and made intercession for me who was Thine enemy. I 
thank Thee that Thy heavens, Thy stars, Thy sun have 
not refused to shine on me. I thank Thee for having 
placed the whole of creation at my service; I have caused 
it to groan beneath the burden of my sin, and yet it has 
not risen up against me. I thank Thee that the very 
earth has not opened beneath my feet to precipitate me 
into the lowest depths of hell, where I indeed deserve 
to be eternally. 

I behold before me, O my God, the mystery of the 
infinite abyss of Thy mercy. I return Thee thanks for 
having preserved my life until this day, for having granted 
to me repentance for my sins; how great has been and 
how incomprehensible remains Thy pity for me! 

Pardon, O perfections of my God, for having pre 
ferred imperfect and vile creatures to Thee! Pardon, O 
justice of my God, for having outraged Thee by my 
crimes! Pardon, O holiness of my God, pardon for 
having so long stained the purity of Thy sight by my 
sins! Pardon, O mercy of my God, for having so long 
despised Thy merciful voice! In deep sorrow and con 
trition I cast myself at Thy feet have mercy on me!

(St. Bernard.) 



PRAYER TO JESUS CHRIST OUR KING THAT WE MAY OBEY 
HIS CALL. 

QY Lord Jesus Christ, Thou hasi said to me: "My 
will is to subject the infidel world to My empire. 
If any one desires to follow Me, he must be content to 
abide beneath My tent, to eat at My table, to drink from 
the same cup with Me ; he must also be willing to labor 
as I labor and with Me; he shall share with Me the 
fruits of the victory in proportion to the manner in which 
he shall have shared with Me the fatigues of the conflict." 
I have reflected upon this Thy call; I have asked of 
Thee, O Jesus Christ, and I still ask of Thee, the grace 
not to be deaf to Thy call, but to answer it joyfully, and 
to give all that Thy most holy will awaits from me. 

Now, after mature consideration, this is what I freely 
offer Thee with my whole heart, protesting it to be my 
firm inward resolution, my determined will, which is 
fixed and will be, I trust, unalterable and steady, and 
which I shall never repent or regret. 

I have understood that the infidel lands to be con 
quered are my soul, my heart, the world, and the devil: 
that the enemies to Thy domain are my sensuality, my 
pride, the spirit of the world ever living and working 
within me ; these are the enemies that I must fight against. 
I have taken the resolution of doing this, and I desire to 
distinguish myself in Thy service. 

I ardently desire to join Thee in this great enterprise 
in which Thou, my Lord Jesus Christ, art leader, and the 
apostles, martyrs, penitents in a word, all the saints, 
are my illustrious companions. 

O eternal King, O Christ, Our Lord and Ruler; under 
Thy protection, by Thy grace, with the memory of Thy 



roc The Spiritual Exercises of Si. Ignatius. 

infinite mercy, at Thy feet, in the presence of Thy glori 
ous Mother and of all the saints who adorn Thy heavenly 
court I offer and consecrate myself to Thee and to Thv 
service alone ; I give myself to Thee without any reserve. 
I am resolved to imitate Thee, I am resolved to follow 
Thee, and to distinguish myself as a follower of Thee, to 
be there where Thou art, if Thy divine Majesty will but 
deign to choose me and to receive me as one of Thy faith 
ful and devoted followers. 

Acknowledging my utter unworthiness, I humbly beg 
of Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, to be graciously pleased 
to accept my whole self as a full and entire oblation. 
Grant that I may live and die at the post where the inter 
ests of Thy glory and my salvation and Thy divine call 
may have placed me. 



PRAYER FOR ASSISTANCE IN CONTEMPLATING THE SCENES 
OF THE GOSPEL. 

*T* BEG of Thee, O God, the grace which I desire to ob- 
*- tain: an intimate knowledge of Our Lord Jesus 
Christ, so that, knowing Him more clearly, I may love 
Him more dearly; that loving Him more dearly, I may 
follow him more nearly; and that following Him more 
nearly, I may attain to a high degree of perfection by 
imitating Him in all things. 

Open, O my God, the eyes of my soul; grant me to 
contemplate in the silence of respect, of prayer, and of 
adoration the eternal Word made flesh (John i. 14), 
placed in the manger (Luke ii. 7), adored by Mary and 
Joseph, the shepherds, the Magi, and the angels (Matt, 
ii. n). Permit me to contemplate and consider the de 
meanor of Jesus; His actions His divine perfection in 
the smallest actions, His voluntary obedience, His toil: 
His bearing its dignity, what modesty in all His 
gestures, His movements, His steps: His looks their 
serenity and sweetness. Let me consider Him in His 



The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. i o i 

sleep. In His prayer what fervor, what recollected- 
ness. When He works what admirable resignation 
and humility. When seated at the humble table of 
Joseph. Let me follow Him when, with the blessing of 
His Mother, He departs to receive baptism by St. John 
when He retires into the desert calls together His 
disciples teaches the multitude. 

Grant, O Lord Jesus, that I may be attentive to Thy 
thoughts, to Thy teachings, to Thy holy will. If Thou 
speakest, may I never lose a single word from Thy lips; 
if Thy lips are silent, grant to me to know and understand 
tfie workings of Thy Sacred Heart; may I be attentive 
alike to what Thou sayest and to what Thou mightest 
say. May Thy voice vibrate through my soul, may it 
enter my heart and be as a salutary food to nourish, vivify, 
and invigorate it. 

Above all, grant that I may love, that I may feel, that 
I may taste, that I may breathe forth to some extent 
the infinite sweetness and gentleness of holiness, the 
exquisite fragrance of virtue; and that I may follow the 
example which Our Lord Jesus Christ has given us by 
His life and teachings. 

Holy cave of Bethlehem, blessed walls of Nazareth, 
where my Jesus, lived, let my lips kiss in spirit these wit 
nesses of the virtues of Christ! Would that I could press 
my lips to all the traces of Thy steps, the earth, the walls 
sanctified by Thy presence, O Jesus! If Thou wilt per 
mit me to approach yet nearer to Thyself, I would fain, 
in the purity and ardor of my love, kiss, as did the 
stricken woman of the Gospels, the hem of Thy garment.

PRAYER TO ATTAIN THE THREE DEGREES OF HUMILITY. 

i. /T\ Y Lord, I beseech of Thee to grant me a grace 

^ * absolutely necessary for the eternal salva 
tion of my soul. It is that I may always have sufficient 
humility, dependence, and submission to obey in all 



IO2 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

things Thy holy law, and that I may never hesitate before 
an order, or break any command of Thine, or of those 
appointed by Thee to command me, which obliges me, 
under pain of mortal sin, not even if by so doing I might 
preserve my life or obtain possession of the whole world. 
May I sacrifice my life, or renounce the empire of the 
entire world, before I willingly transgress any of Thy 
precepts. 

2. Lord, I ask of Thee a greater grace than that of 
never offending Thee by mortal sin: may I always have 
sufficient humility and submission never to give way to 
the temptation of committing a single deliberate venial 
sin, even if by so doing I might save my life or acquire 
possession of the whole world. My heart will falter, it 
will often hesitate before the thought of venial sin, if it 
is not indifferent between riches ar.d poverty, between 
honor and shame, between life and Jeath. Grant me, 
O God, this perfect indifference of soul. 

3. O Lord, I ask of Thee a still greater grace than that 
of never offending Thee by venial sin. May my soul be 
so humble, so entirely submissive, that it may no longer 
have aught but one desire: to imitate Thee and to follow 
Thee, its Lord and its God. 

Even if the interests of the glory of God are not in 
volved or affected, in order to resemble more closely Our 
Lord Jesus Christ, I will and desire to be poor with Jesus 
Christ in His poverty rather than to be rich, since Jesus 
Christ was not rich. I will and desire to be covered with 
ignominy rather than to be honored by the world, since 
Jesus Christ was not honored by it. I will and desire 
to be looked upon as a being useless to all, of little inter 
est, of little repute, of little influence, of little learning 
and wisdom, since such was the estimation in which the 
world held Our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Grant me, O Lord, to arrive at this third and highest 
degree of perfection, and the grace of a perfect renuncia 
tion of myself after Thine example.

PRAYER ON THE THREE CLASSES. 

LORD, I beg of Thee the grace not to belong to that 
class of Christians, who, convinced of the truth of 
religion, are not converted or sanctified, because they will 
not make use of the means by which sanctity may be 
acquired and their conversion assured. Grant that I 
may not be with those who give Thee desires only, and 
who put off, from day to day, the means necessary for 
holiness and salvation, and who do nothing until the day 
of their death. 

Lord, I ask of Thee the grace not to belong to that 
class of men who indeed desire holiness, but who at the 
same time will not make the sacrifice at all, who can not 
bring themselves to renounce certain passions, who will 
only give to Thee certain works, who would have Thee 
and at the same time retain possession of certain worldly 
advantages, who will not choose the most certain means 
of holiness. They are very willing that Thou shouldst 
come to them, but they can not persuade themselves to 
go to Thee; and yet what a happy lot would be theirs if 
they had but the courage to give themselves unreservedly 
to Thee! With what superabundant graces dost Thou 
reward the sacrifices of generous souls, O my God! 

Lord, I ask of Thee to grant me the grace of being in 
the class of those whose will is in a state of such perfect 
equilibrium, that it neither accepts nor rejects anything 
except as Thou inspirest it to accept or reject it. 

I desire nothing, O my God, unless Thou first wiliest 
it; I wish for nothing except to serve Thee, my Crfeator 
and my Saviour; and if the voice of nature asks anything 
different of me, it is my will and desire to go against this 
voice of nature, this natural repugnance. And I pray 
and beseech Thee to grant and vouchsafe to me, though 
in opposition to my natural inclination, and notwithstand 
ing the reluctance of nature, that I may have the grace 



ic&amp;gt;4 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

accorded me of always acting solely for the greater honor 
and glory of Thy infinite Majesty, the grace of always 
choosing what is for Thy greater glory; and to this end 
I beseech of Thee the grace of perfect and effective 
detachment

PRAYER THAT WE MAY BE RECEIVED UNDER THE STAND 
ARD OF OUR DIVINE KING. 

LORD, behold me a suppliant praying before Thee. 
I come to implore of Thee a grace which is repug 
nant to my nature and which I dread to obtain. Alas, my 
heart is not indifferent: on the contrary, it rebels at the 
thought of voluntary poverty, and the contempt of men. 
It is to master my natural inclinations, to vanquish self, 
and to conquer my heart, to extinguish in it every spark 
of that self-love which is not in accordance with the rule 
these exercises place before me, that I entreat Thee to 
receive me under Thy standard. 

May Thy divine Majesty deign to shelter me beneath 
me folds of this Thy holy standard, to give me the spirit 
of poverty and detachment, and to call me even to the 
practice of actual and perfect poverty, if such is Thy 
good pleasure. Lord Jesus, in order that I may re 
semble Thee more closely, grant me a share, I beseech 
Thee, in Thy humiliations, and in the injustices that 
Thou didst meet with, provided that I can bear them 
without committing any sin, without ever displeasing, 
in any way, Thy divine Majesty.

PRAYER BEFORE ELECTION. 

RANT, O Lord, to the eyes of mine understanding 
the light of a pure, upright, and single intention; 
may I always be mindful of the end for which Thou hast 
created me Thy glory and my eternal salvation. Help 
me, O God, to keep this end in view, enlighten my spirit, 
and incline my will toward the calling I should choose. 

Before proceeding to my decision, I will with Thy 
help behold present to me in heaven the throne of the 
most Holy Trinity, of my Redeemer and Saviour, the 
most blessed Virgin Mary, the angels, the saints, and all 
the elect of God. 

May my resolution have their approval and assent! 
Above all, O my Creator and my God, I beseech Thee 
to communicate Thyself to my soul, and to bind it by 
ever closer ties to Thee and to Thy holy service. 

Grant me the grace to come to my decision and to act- 
as I should act if I were now at the hour of my death as 
I should counsel another, a stranger, or a friend, to act 
under similar circumstances to mine to decide as at the 
day of judgment, before Thy tribunal, I should then 
wish I had now decided. 

Before all, O my God, impress well upon my mind 
this important maxim, that the measure of my progress 
in spiritual things will be that of my abnegation of self, 
and that so much the more as I shall go out of myself, as 
I shall trample on my self-love, my self-will, my natural 
disposition, as I shall ignore and leave behind me that 



106 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

self, so much the more closely shall I approach to Thee, 
be united to and resemble Thee. 

O Lord, if Thou hast approved of my decision, if it is 
agreeable to Thee, accept and bless it, confirm me in it, 
and grant to me steadfastly to persevere in it, in peace of 
mind, without regrets or doubts, to Thy greater honor 
and glory. Amen.

PRAYER IN DESOLATION. 

/T\Y Lord and my God, I am tempted and in desola- 
^ tion; my soul is sad and languishes within me; 
my spirit droops; I am as if separated from Thee, with 
out hope, without love. I am anxious, agitated, and 
uneasy; my heart is troubled. I am tormented, I falter, 
I am languid, overwhelmed, and weary with the conflict. 
Inferior and terrestrial things are enticing me, they charm 
and draw me to them. 

O my God, help! come to my assistance, give me 
courage, give me strength, allow me not to be overcome 
by the assaults of the evil one ; discover to me his snares 
and artifices. 

If Thou hast left me, it is because I have been tepid 
and negligent in my exercises of piety. My faults have 
deprived me of Thy consolations. 

Perhaps also it is that Thou wiliest to show me how 
little I can do when left to myself how little I can do 
alone, for Thy service, for Thy glory how weak and 
powerless I am when deprived of Thy aid. Or Thou 
art proving me; Thou wiliest to see how I employ my 
self for Thy service and glory when Thou dost not be 
stow on me every day the rewards of Thy Spirit in gifts 
and sensible graces. Thou desirest to prove what I am, 
and if I se -ve Thee for Thyself, or only for the reward 
of Thy divine consolations. Or perhaps Thou wiliest 
to detach my heart from a certain self-confidence, and 
thus to hold it back from the pitfall of pride and self- 



The Spiritual Exercises of Si. Ignatius. 107 

love, so dangerous to our salvation; to forbid it to seek 
elsewhere than in Thyself its repose, its security, and its 
peace. 

But what I do know is, that with Thy grace, which 
Thou wilt never refuse me, and of which Thou wilt never 
deprive me although I may not always be sensible or 
conscious of its presence, I shall be able to resist and 
overcome all my enemies; therefore, establishing my 
confidence on Thy divine strength, I will not lose courage. 

It only remains for me to humble myself, to abase 
myself to the very dust at the sight of my nothingness, 
and to persevere in my former resolutions made in the 
day of consolation, awaiting in patience and calm for, 
and looking with hope and confidence to, Thy next visit; 
for I know that the day of desolation will pass, and that 
consolation will not be long in coming. 

Give me patience and hope, give me the courage to 
remain fixed in my resolutions, to attack and fight with 
the enemy without making any change in my former 
decisions; but, in order to dissipate this desolation, let 
me change myself, by being more recollected, more atten 
tive, more silent, more mortified; above all, by applying 
myself more fervently to prayer and meditation.

PRAYER THAT WE MAY UNITE OURSELVES WITH THE 
SUFFERINGS OF OUR LORD. 

the foot of the cross I ask of Thee, O my God, 
the grace which I should first of all seek to obtain 
in considering the Passion of Our Lord. I ask an in 
tense sorrow with Jesus Christ overwhelmed by sorrows; 
I ask for a broken heart in union with the Sacred Heart 
of Jesus Christ in its agony. I beg of Thee tears to weep 
over the grief of Jesus Christ, a deep and sincere sympa 
thy and compassion for the sufferings of Jesus Christ, 



io8 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

and a lasting remembrance of all the profound sorrows 
and pains He endured for me. 

I beg of Thee, O God, a lively contrition for my sins, 
and for the agony and sufferings they have caused Our 
Lord, and a tender love for Jesus Christ suffering for 
me. 

Ah, it is for my sins, my Lord Jesus Christ, that Thou 
dost advance to meet these torments. I have looked 
upon Thy bruised and wounded body, I have listened to 
Thy words in Thy affliction and distress, so full of tender 
ness and love, so full of sorrow and of pain; I have fol 
lowed Thee along all the paths of Jerusalem: from the 
room of the Last Supper to the Garden of Gethsemane, 
from the Garden of Gethsemane to the house of Caiphas, 
the high priest, from the high priest to Pilate, from Pilate 
to Herod, from Herod back to the Roman governor, 
from the governor s hall to Calvary, and there I have 
gazed on Thee nailed to the cross! 

Behold what Thou hast suffered, O my God! and Thou 
wouldst suffer it all again and still more for me were it 
necessary! So great is Thy love that it is, as it were, 
more insatiable and cruel to Thyself than even the hate 
of Thy executioners! 

May my eyes pour forth tears at this sad sight! O my 
soul, let the waters of tribulation overwhelm thee; 
make every effort, strive with thyself, if necessary, to 
keep alone before thy sight thy crucified Saviour, to 
compassionate Him, to mourn, to sorrow, to lament and 
bewail with Jesus crucified. 

Where, O where is Thy Divinity hidden, O my Jesus ? 
;vhy does not it arise to scatter and annihilate all Thy 
; .nemies ? Why does it permit Thy most holy Humanity 
to suffer such indignities, such excruciating torments, 
torments beyond all bound and measure ? 

O God, I realize it! All these terrible sufferings are 
necessary for the effacing of my sins! Behold to what a 
state they have reduced Thee! Behold what Thy love 



The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 1 09 

has found needful to suffer for me! What does it now 
behoove me to suffer for Thee? 

Consider, my soul, what gifts thou wilt offer at the 
foot of the cross: what wilt thou do and suffer for Thy 
God. 

How can I refuse aught to Thee, my Lord and my 
Creator, Who hast done and suffered so much for my 
sake; Thou hast given all Thou hast to me; Thou hast 
given Thy labor, Thy toil, Thy thoughts, Thy love, 
Thy life, the very last drop of Thy Heart s blood for me. 
Ah! let me give Thee all I have all my affections, all 
my love, all my desires, my whole heart, my work, my 
efforts, my sorrows, my joys, my life, my whole self.

PRAYER TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST RISEN FROM THE 
DEAD. 



me, O Jesus, the grace I seek in this medi- 
tation on Thy glorious Resurrection; it is that I 
may rejoice with Thee, that I may exult over, and par 
ticipate in, Thy joy and Thy glory. 

How beautiful art Thou, O my well-beloved! How 
beautiful and radiant are the wounds in Thy hands and 
Thy feet ! And still more beautiful and still more radiant 
is the wound in Thy Sacred Heart! What ineffable sweet 
ness, what light in Thy words! Happy Peter, happy 
Magdalen! still happier thou, O blessed Mother of Our 
Lord, united to Him in the glory of His triumph! 

Let me contemplate, O my Jesus, the splendor of 
Thy Divinity. It seemed to hide itself during Thy 
Passion, but now that Thou art risen, how clearly does 
it shine, how evident it is to me as I recognize and con 
fess it, and the truth and holiness of Thy presence, and 
of Thy apparitions which brought such peace and con 
solation with them! 



no The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

What so overjoys and fills me with gratitude in con 
templating Thee, O Lord Jesus, is the loving care Thou 
hast to bring -consolation to Thy servants. This tender 
care and loving thought for those who are Thine fills 
me with a great joy, and deep love and gratitude. O 
Jesus Christ, the Consoler, Thou Who so well knowest 
how to fulfil this office, this royal ministry of Thy love; 
how immense is the difference, how great the contrast 
between what friends can say to console their friends, 
and what Thou sayest and dost to console Thy disciples! 

divine Consoler, be Thou my consoler! Give to me 
that true consolation, that consolation which is the in 
crease of faith, of hope, and of charity. 

1 congratulate thee, O most holy Virgin Mother, on 
thy happiness, and I participate in thy joy. 

Regina Cceli. 

I adore Thee, O Jesus, in the glory of Thy Resurrec 
don, in the immutability of Thy beatitude, and I con

Glory be to the Father. 



PRAYER TO EXCITE LOVE FOR GOD. 

LORD, I ask of Thee the grace to realize intimately 
the greatness and excellence of Thy blessed bene 
fits which Thou hast so lavishly poured forth on me; I 
beg of Thee that I may realize the full extent of Thy 
generosity, the prodigality of Thy Heart, so that measur 
ing my gratitude by Thy marvellous generosity, it may 
make that return which justice and love require by serv 
ing Thee in and by Thy gifts, and consecrating myself to 
Thy love and service. 

It is from Thee that I have received the benefits of 
creation, and all those special gifts of grace which never 
fail me in my dangers and my difficulties. How good 



The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. in 

hast Thou been to me in particular above so many 
others, who are more worthy than I am. 

Let me reflect upon the past! Thy love, never sat 
isfied with giving, would always give more. Ah, my 
God, I am confident, I know that in Thy love Thou wilt 
never be satisfied, until Thou hast given me Thyself 
entirely and for ever in heaven. 

And now in my turn, what can I do for Thee ? What 
is meet, just, and right that I should offer to Thy 
divine Majesty? I have nothing of myself, I hold all 
from God ; what else, then, can I do but offer Thee all 
that I have, all that I am? 

Suscipe, Domine : Take, O Lord, and receive my 
entire liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my 
whole will. All that I am, all that I have, Thou hast 
given me, and I restore it all to Thee, to be dis 
posed of according to Thy good pleasure. Give me 
only Thy love and Thy grace; with these I am rich 
enough, and I desire nothing more. 

But Thou art present, Thou dwellest in all these Thy 
benefits, in all creatures, in myself. It is Thou who 
didst create and dost give existence to the elements; 
Thou who causest them to be Thou who dost give 
life to the plants, and causest them to grow. Thou who 
hast given to animals sensation. Thou who hast given 
man intelligence, the power of thought, an immortal soul. 
Thus Thou hast united all Thy gifts and given them all 
to me, life, sensation, reason. I have been created in 
Thy likeness, and am as an image of Thy divine Majesty. 
In the most noble and excellent manner Thou dwellest 
in me, Thou dost dwell in me as in Thy temple, as in a 
sanctuary, seeing in me Thine own image, and finding 
in me an intelligence, capable of knowing and loving 
Thee. What then can I do to honor in His gifts Him 
Who presents them to me and Who maintains them by 
His power? What can I do except treat them with an 
infinite respect, and walk always in the presence of God, 



H2 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

thinking and acting in His presence which surrounds 
and penetrates even within me. 

Thou, my Benefactor, art always with me; Thou art 
more intimately united to me than is my soul to my 
body; help me then, O my God, help me to keep myself 
before Thee as a child in the presence of a tenderly-loved 
father, studying the slightest sign of Thy will and Thy 
wish. 

O my God, not only dost Thou dwell in the whole of 
creation, not only art Thou present in the entire uni 
verse, but Thou dost act continually in all Thy creatures, 
and dost work in them for ever, for my service. 

Yes! divine Artificer, Thine infinite power, occupy 
ing itself in the heavens, the elements, the fruits of the 
earth, becomes as it were the servant of my needs; Thou 
dost light my path, enlighten me with the light of day; 
Thou dost nourish me with the productions of the earth, 
?.nd serve me by each one of the creatures I use! Thy 
bounty, wisdom, and power, are placed at my service, 
and exercised for my wants and pleasures. 

Help me, O my God, to serve Thee, acting always 
solely for Thee, and in Thy presence, uniting work with 
recollection, calm contemplation of Thee with activity 
in Thy service; let me think always of Thee, but with 
out ceasing to act, and let me act, but in such a manner 
as not to be distracted and without ceasing to think of 
Thee. That I may attain to this perfection in all that 
I do, grant that I may seek but one end in the diversity 
of my occupations Thy good pleasure and holy will, 
O my God. 

So Thou art in all these gifts which I receive from 
Thee; it is in them and by them that Thou dost serve 
me. 

Behind the veil of these creatures I discern Thy fa 
therly hand which presents them to me, and fashions them 
to my service. If then, they come from Thee to me, it 
is but just that from me they should return to Thee. It is 



The Spiritual Exercises of Si. Ignatius. i } 3 

with this intent that I have offered all to Thee; for the 
future I will to see in creatures only the good and useful 
means they may offer of serving and praising Thee, and 
to use them only so long as, and inasmuch as, they shall 
serve to this end. I will to be detached from creatures 
and myself; this double detachment will give me true 
liberty of spirit, which consists in being no longer bound 
either to creatures or myself, and in reposing perfectly 
and solely on Thy love. 

I will to be detached from creatures because they havt 
only very limited perfections; the most perfect being 
but as a weak and rude image of Thy perfections. What 
tixey have of the good and beautiful is but an emanation 
of Thy Divinity, which rests on them as the rays of the 
sun rest on the moon and glorify it; but as the moon is 
pale in the presence of the sun, shining as it does with 
but a borrowed light, so creatures have but a very faint 
reflection of Thy perfections. 

I will to be detached from myself, because all my being 
and happiness depend not on myself but on Thee; if I 
leave myself I shall find Thee, and in Thee I find as in 
their source and in an infinite degree all perfections. In 
Thee and in Thee alone shall I find my happiness and 
my being. "Thou hast made us, O Lord, for Thyself, 
and our hearts can not rest until they rest in Thee" (St. 
Augustine;. Thou hast said, O Lord: "He that loveth 
his life shall lose it: and he that hateth his life ir. this 
world, keepeth it unto life eternal" (John xii. 25). 

O give me then, my Lord, this perfect detachment, 
since in that state my soul will be absolutely indifferent 
to all that is not Thee. I shall then have but one thought 
to please Thee in all my actions; but one desire soon 
to quit this world, in order fully to possess Thee, my God, 
in heaven. 

The little that I am flows from a Being so infinitely- 
elevated above me; from Thee, O eternal Source, descend 
justice, comfort, sweetness, piety, gentleness, goodness. 



ii4 The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. 

pour down into my soul Thy gifts, inundate me with 
Thy perfections, and grant me such entire conformity 
to Thy will that I may attain to perfect repose in Thee. 

O living Light, O heavenly Sun, the source from 
whence proceed all those beams of light which illuminate 
the souls of the saints, flooding them with an effulgence 
of celestial radiance, let me be engulfed and lose myself 
in Thee! May I forget myself, and leave myself; may 

1 strip myself of all love of creatures to love Thee alone, 
my Creator and my God. May I leave both creatures 
and myself in order to attach myself only to Thee, my 
Lord and my God. May I see Thee alone in the whole 
of creation, serving Thee and Thee only, reposing and 
rejoicing for ever in Thy most holy will. Amen.

BELIEVE that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall

my resurrection be a glorious one. This hope rests

Thyself, that space be no longer found therein for crea

Jesus, to fall from bodily into spiritual sleep, but awaken 
my heart, my spirit, and my will unto Thy love, in which 
I desire to persevere, like the angels, without interrup

Thee that nothing shall be able to sever me from Thee.

No cherish d madness vex the soul! 
May abstinence the flesh restrain, 

And its rebellious pride control. 

So when the evening stars appear, 
And in their train the darkness bring; 

May we, O Lord, with conscience clear, 
Our praise to Thy pure glory sing. 

To God the Father, glory be, 

And to His sole-begotten Son, 
Glory, O Holy Ghost, to Thee, 

While everlasting ages run.

presence. And now, my dearest Lord, I have come in

thanks for abiding with us "all days," for having pro

having given me another day to labor for Thy greater 
honor and glory, and for the salvation of my soul. In 
reparation for all the sufferings that Thy Sacred Heart 
endures in the Blessed Sacrament, I offer Thee the 
adoration and praise of all the just on earth, of all the

child; draw me to Thee in ever closer union with Thy 
loving Sacred Heart; make me resigned to Thy holy 
will, and grant that I may be found worthy one day of 
that reward which Thou hast promised to those who 
love and serve Thee faithfully on earth. Give me Thy 
grace, that I may become a saint. Oh, stay with us.

Consecration of TReif0iou0 Communities. 

SACRED Heart of Jesus, whence came those 
words of truly ineffable love: "Come to Me 
all you that labor and are burdened, and I will refresh 
you." Relying upon this promise of Thine infinite 
tenderness and charity, in the trial? and hardships of 
our times, when the universal Church is attacked in her 
chief Pastor and in her religious children, we betake 
ourselves to Thee. We have determined to consecrate 
to Thee for ever, solemnly and anew, this our house, 
ourselves, and all that belongs to us. Do Thou gra 
ciously look down upon us and accept our vows, that, 
sealed by Thy grace, they may ever remain firm and 
unchangeable. 

Wherefore, dearest Jesus, our sovereign Lord and 
Leader, we, although most unworthy members of this 
(College, Convent, Academy, House, etc., N.N.), yet 
trusting in Thy help and grace, offer, and consecrate 
ourselves and our household entirely to Thy most 
Sacred Heart, and we submit ourselves and all that 
we have to Thy most holy will. 

We call upon our blessed Lady, Thy Virgin Mother, 
our Founder N., and the whole court of heaven to wit 
ness that this is our intention, our desire, and our firm 
determination to imitate as closely as possible Thy 
most Sacred Heart in practising the virtues belonging 
to our state of life, in order that we may promote Thy 
glory in ourselves, and make some reparation for all 
the grievous insults offered to Thee. 

We, therefore, implore Thee, dearest Jesus, to pro 
tect our house, to guard us Thy servants for ever in Thy 
most Sacred Heart, and to sanctify our labors, our 
studies, and trials. May we, by Thy grace, advance 
Thy greater glory, the salvation of souls, and devotion 
to Thy most Sacred Heart. Amen.

Bet ot Consecration for "Keltgious. 

Yen. de la Colombiere. 

MY amiable Redeemer. I give and consecrate 
myself to Thy Sacred Heart without reserve. 

I have in a manner nailed myself to Thy cross by the 
vows of my profession; I renew them in this divine 
Heart in presence of heaven and earth ; and I return Thee 
thanks for having inspired me to make them. 

, I own that the yoke of Thy holy service is neither hard 
nor heavy; I do not find myself embarrassed with my 
chains; on the contrary, I would wish to multiply them, 
or rivet them yet closer upon me. 

I embrace, then, the dear cross of my vocation, even 
to my death; it shall be all my pleasure, all my glory, 
and aft my delight. 

God forbid that I should glory, that I should ever 
rejoice, save in the cross of Jesus Christ. 

God iorbid that I should ever have any other treasure 
than His poverty, any other delight than His sufferings, 
any other love than Himself. 

No, no, my amiable Lord, never will I separate myself 
from Thee; and I will attach myself to none but Thee; 
the narrowest paths of the life of perfection to which I 
am called give me no alarm, because Thou art my light 
and my strength. 

I hope, then, O Lord, that Thou wilt render me stead 
fast under all temptations, victorious against the efforts 
of my enemies, and that Thou wilt stretch out over me 
that beneficent hand, which has bestowed upon me so 
many favors, and make me ever more and more liberal 
toward Thee. 

I entreat this of Thee, O my adorable Jesus, by Thy 
blood, by all Thy wounds, and by Thy Sacred Heart. 

Grant that by the consecration which I make to Thee 
of all that I am, I may become this day entirely renewed 
in Thy love. Amen.

Thee, and particularly this day. Give me light to see

Commandments of God; poverty, chastity, obedience; the 
Holy Rule; the predominant passion; resolutions; prayers, works, 
and sufferings. Does your conscience reproach you with regard 
to any of these points? 

OMY God, forgive me my offences; I am truly 
sorry for having sinned, because Thou art infi 
nitely good, and sin displeases Thee. I purpose, with 
the help of Thy grace, never to sin again. I love Thee 
above all things, and with my whole heart, because 
Thou art infinitely amiable and worthy of all love. 

I beseech Thee, Lord, to preserve me this night, and 
to keep me from all sin. I take this sleep to please Thee, 
and I have the intention to love Thee, praise Thee, and 
thank Thee with every breath I draw, in union with the 
angels and saints in heaven. 

OMOST amiable Heart of Jesus! let me, my relatives,

Joseph, my good angel, and my dear patron saints, pray 
for me. 

AY Our Lord bless us, and preserve us from all 
evil, and bring us to life everlasting. And may 
the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of 
God, rest in peace. Amen. 

A PRAYER FOR A HAPPY DEATH. 

In Connection with the Seven Last Words of Our Lord 

on the Cross. 

IVINE Jesus! Incarnate Word of God! Who 
having taken flesh for my salvation, didst vouch 
safe to be born in a stable, to lead a life of poverty, toil, 
and love, and finally to expire in agony on the cross: 
Say, I beseech Thee, to Thy eternal Father at the moment 
of my death: " Father, forgive her; " say to Thy blessed 
Mother: " Behold thy child;" say to my soul: " To-day 
shalt thou be with Me in paradise." 

My God, my God, forsake me not in that hour! "I 
thirst!" Yea, my soul thirsts, O my God, after Thee; 
Thou art the Fountain of living waters. 

My life is passing away as a tale that is told; yet a 
little while, and all will be " consummated ;" therefore 
my adorable Saviour, even from this moment, for all 
eternity: "Into Thy hands I commend my spirit." My 
Jesus, mercy!

IRlgbt Offering to tbe JBIesscD Sacrament. 

DIVINE Jesus! lonely to-night in so many taber- 
nacles, without visitor or worshipper, I offer Thee 
my poor, but loving heart. May every pulsation be a 
prayer of love to Thee. Thou art ever watching under 
the sacramental veils; in Thy love Thou never sleepest, 
and Thou art never weary of Thy vigil for sinners. O 
good Jesus, I love Thee. Thou art infinitely good, 
and I have displeased Thee by many sins. Forgive 
me I am truly sorry for having offended Thee. O 
sweet Jesus . O lonely Jesus! may my heart be a lamp, 
the light of which shall burn henceforth for Thee alone. 
Bless me, Jesus. Come, and refresh me spiritually by 
Thy presence, before I take my repose. Let me never 
more be separated from Thee by sin. Adorable Heart 
of Jesus, burning furnace of divine love! within Thy 
sacred wound take Thou my soul, in order that my 
heart may be inflamed with the love of Thee. 

O Prisoner of love! divine Jesus! chain my poor heart 

to the foot of Thy altar. Dearest Jesus, Thou hast 

made my heart for Thyself alone, and it will not find 

rest, except in Thee ; hide it within Thy divine Heart in 

the tabernacle. When shall I see Thee face to face, and

Because He hath regarded

Because He that is mighty

And His mercy is from

He hath showed might

He hath put down the 
mighty from their seat, and 
hath exalted the humble. 

He hath filled the hungry 
with good things: and th

He hath helped His ser

Educes me de laqueo hoc, 
quern absconderunt mihi : 
quoniam tu es protector 
meus. 

In manus tuas commendo

a protector, and a house of 
refuge: to save me. 

For Thou art my strength 
and my refuge: and for Thy 
name s sake, Thou wilt lead 
me and nourish me. 

Thou wilt bring me out of 
this snare, which they have 
hidden for me: for Thou art 
my protector. 

Into Thy hands I commend

Because Thou, O Lord,

There shall no evil come to

angels charge over thee: to 
keep thee in all thy ways. 

In their hands they shall 
bear thee up: lest thou dash 
thy foot against a stone. 

Thou shalt walk upon the 
asp and the basilisk: and 
thou shalt trample under

Because he hath hoped in 
Me, I will deliver him: I will

known My name. 

He shall cry to Me, and I 

will hear him: I am with him 

in his trouble: I will deliver 

him, and I will glorify him. 

I will fill him with length

Majesty, in the name of all creatures. But how can I 
do it I, a wretched sinner? Yes, I can, and I will do

the Father of mercy, and that, for love of us, Thou hast 
given even Thy only-begotten Son, Who offered Him 
self for us on the cross, and Who continually renews for

us the same sacrifice on our altars. And therefore, 
though a sinner, yet truly penitent; wretched, and yet 
rich in Jesus Christ, I present myself before Thee, and 
with the fervor of all the saints and angels, and with 
the ardent love of the immaculate heart of Mary, I offer 
Thee, in the name of all creatures, the Masses which are 
now being said, with all those which have been said, and 
which will be said to the end of the world. I also desire 
to renew this offering, at every instant of this day, and 
of my whole life, in order to give Thy infinite majesty 
honor and glory worthy of Thee; to appease Thy wrath, 
and to satisfy Thy justice for our many sins; to render 
Thee thanks in keeping with Thy benefits, and to im 
plore Thy mercy for myself and for all sinners, for all 
the faithful, living and dead, for the whole Church, and 
chiefly for its visible head, the Roman Pontiff; and 
lastly, for all poor schismatics, heretics, and infidels, that 
they may also be converted and saved.

Lord and my God, permit me to offer Thee my

are offered Thee by the priest, to the end that they may 
be changed into the body and blood of Thy divine Son. 
Oh! so let me be changed into the semblance of Him. 
All is pure in Him, and all is profane in me. It was to 
reform what the malice of the devil and sin had defaced 
of Thy image, that my Saviour immolated Himself on 
the cross, and it is for that He now sacrifices Himself on 
this altar. Oh! repair in me His image by that precious 
blood which flowed from His sacred wounds, and which 
will soon flow on this altar. Take away from me the per 
verse inclinations which lead me into sin, change my 
tepidity into fervor, take possession of me, O my God, 
and make me wholly Thine. Imprint on my memory 
the remembrance of Thy divine presence, in my under

Thanksgiving. 

/T\Y Lord Jesus Christ! I thank Thee for the grace 
M^ which Thou hast bestowed upon me to-day of 
coming to dwell within me and of nourishing me with 
Thy sacred body and precious blood. 

Saints and angels! in my unworthiness I call upon

shall I render to the Lord for all the things that He hath 
rendered to me?" (Ps. cxv. 12.) 

Love. 

/T\Y Lord Jesus Christ, how great is Thy love! I 
^"^ now return Thee love for love, according to my

and I will avoid everything that is displeasing to Thee. 

Prayer of St. Ignatius. 

f? AKE, O Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory,

with these I will be rich enough, and will have no more 
to desire.

DIVINE Jesus! sacred Victim, immolated for 
the redemption of mankind, I earnestly beseech 



Methods of Hearing Mass. 215 

Thee that I may assist at this adorable sacrifice with the 
most lively faith, animated hope, unbounded gratitude, 
and tender love; permit me to follow Thee in spirit 
through the different stages of Thy sacred Passion, and 
give me an abundant share of that infinite charity which 
induced Thee to suffer such excessive torments for my 
sake. I offer this divine sacrifice to commemorate in 
a special manner Thy Passion and death, and to obtain, 
through its efficacious merits, the conversion of tepid 
priests and Religious ; furthermore that union and charity 
may reign in this Community, and that all its members 
may be filled with zeal for the conversion of sinners, for 
whom Thou didst die; and for myself, the spirit of mor 
tification and humility, light and prudence in the dis 
charge of my office, patience and forbearance with those 
under my care, purity of intention, simplicity, diffidence 
in self, confidence in God. But, O my Jesus, Thou 
needest not my representation to discern my wants. I 
am too weak, too insensible, to feel my miseries as I ought, 
too guilty to deserve being heard; let my silence then 
speak. O most merciful Saviour! let my multiplied 
miseries plead in my behalf. Thou wilt not be deaf to 
their eloquent supplications, and surely, O my Jesus! 
Thou needest but consult Thy own Heart, and that 
infinite love which brings Thee daily upon our altars, 
to find motives for granting pardon, and mercy to me, 
a poor sinner.

Represent to yourself Jesus Christ retiring to the Gar 
den of Gethsemane to pray : unite your sentiments with 
the divine dispositions of the Son of God, and prepare for 
this divine sacrifice of the Mass by acts oj sincere contrition: 

J7ESUS, in the Garden of Olives, shed His blood for 
J us in such streams that it bathed the earth around. 



2i6 Methods of Hearing Mass. 

This He did at the vision He then had of the ingratitude 
with which men would meet His love. Oh! let us, then, 
repent sincerely for the past, considering how poorly we 
have met the countless benefits of Our Lord, and re 
solve henceforth to make good use of His graces and holy 
inspirations. 

O my good Jesus, my dear Saviour, I compassionate 
Thee in Thy sufferings. I fervently bless Thee and 
thank Thee for all Thou hast done and suffered for me; 
give me grace to weep over the sins and the ingratitude 
which caused Thy dreadful agony. Sweet Jesus, mercy ! 
Pardon me, O Lord, for my past indifference to Thy love. 
Heart of Jesus, inflamed with love of us, inflame our 
hearts with love of Thee. 

AT THE KYRIE ELEISON. 

Represent Jesus taken and bound with cords, and say: 
those bonds which confined Thy hands burst 



the fetters of my sins, and restore me to the sweet 
liberty of Thy children! I cast myself at Thy sacred 
feet, O my King and my God: and since Thou hast 
undergone the humiliation of allowing Thyself to be 
bound by Thy creatures, may I place all my happiness 
in sharing Thy humiliations, and carrying Thy cross. 

AT THE GOSPEL. 

Reflect on the patience and benignity of Jesus in allow 
ing Himself to be dragged from tribunal to tribunal, and 
say: 

SPOTLESS Lamb of God! while Thy judges 
proclaim Thee an impostor, I rise without fear 
or shame to declare, in the face of heaven and earth, that 
Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God, and that I 
unreservedly assent to all and every article proposed by 
Thy holy Church to my belief: but, O divine Lord, give 
me grace to profess by my actions as well as by my words

the faith. Have mercy on all who are involved in the 
dreadful night of infidelity : may the light of Thy grace 
shine upon them, and so penetrate their hearts that they 
may embrace the truth, and be admitted to the commun 
ion of Thy holy Church. 

AT THE OFFERTORY. 

Represent Jesus bound tojhe pillar and cruelly scourged: 

T7ESUS, in His cruel scourging, shed His blood most 
J painfully and abundantly, offering it to His 
eternal Father in payment of our impatience and our 
wantonness. How is it, then, that we do not curb our 
wrath and self-love? Oh! let us henceforth try to be 
r?ore patient in our trials, to despise ourselves, and to 
boar in peace the injuries men do us. 

O Jesus, Thou art the Love and Life of my soul. I 
find true peace and real happiness only in Thy love, in 
Thy service, and in the imitation of Thy virtues. I offer 
myself to Thee; do what Thou wiliest with me; hence 
forth my motto shall be, "All for Jesus." 

Jesus, meek and humble of Heart, make my heart like 
unto Thine. 

Sweet Heart of Jesus, be my love!

Contemplate thy Saviour crowned with thorns; reflect on 
the words "Behold the man," and say: 

BEHOLD me, O most merciful Jesus: A poor sin

with sorrow for my sins. Oh! let not pride any longer 
occupy my heart, which Thou, my Saviour, hast so 
tenderly loved and redeemed at so great a price; cleanse 
my poor soul, O Jesus, from all offensive stains, and 
drown my imperfections in the boundless ocean of Thy 
mercy-

AT THE PREFACE. 

DIVINE Jesus, grant me a share in Thy zeal for 
Thy Father s glory, that in union with the dom 
inations, principalities, and the whole hierarchy of angels, 
I may anticipate in my exile the ever new canticle, which 
they incessantly sing in the abode of bliss: Holy, thrice 
holy, infinitely holy is the Lord of hosts! the heavens 
and the earth are full of His glory, but His mercies have 
been exalted above all His works, since Thou, O divine 
Jesus, hast descended from His bosom, and come in His 
name to dwell in this valley of tears nay, more, to dwell 
in unworthy hearts. 

AFTER THE ELEVATION. 

ETERNAL Father! behold Thy beloved Son, my 
blessed Saviour, Whom I humbly offer to Thy 
divine Majesty in satisfaction for all my offences and 
ingratitude. 

I offer Thee His purity, His innocence, to arone for 
my defilement; His humility, for my pride; His zeal, for 
my tepidity ; and the holiness of His life, for all the imper 
fections of mine. 

O merciful Father! look on the charity of Thy Son; 
behold how He once offered Himself a bloody sacrifice 
for my salvation, and how He now offers Himself in an 
unbloody manner on this altar for the same end. O holy 
Father! receive this His sacrifice in lieu of all the honor, 
homage, and gratitude due to Thy goodness from me and 
all Thy creatures. 

O my sweet Saviour! I thank Thee for Thy love and 
Thy mercy. I thank Thee, also, for all the wondrous 
prerogatives and dignities which Thou hast conferred on 
Mary, the Queen of heaven. I love Thee with my whole 
heart. What pledge of my love can I give Thee? 
Thou hast asked my heart: take it, Loid Jesus, take it

receive (if you do not communicate actually, make at least 
a spiritual communion), that peace which the world can 
not give, and which can alone be found in union with 
Thee, O divine Victim! O Jesus, my life and my sal 
vation, when Thou enteresi into my heart in holy com 
munion, impress on it the lessons of humility, meek 
ness, patience, charity, and sweetness, so strongly incul 
cated by Thy precepts and example. O Mary! show 
thyself now my tender Mother and powerful advocate, 
that I may receive with faith, purity, fervor, humility, 
and confidence thy own beloved Son, and my sweet 
Saviour and Master. O blessed spirits of heaven, and, 
above all, my dear angel guardian, intercede for me, and 
supply, by your ardent adorations, for my want of fervor 
when I receive my Redeemer. 

Make an act of contrition, a renewal of vows, and then 
with jervent aspirations invite your Saviour into your 
heart.

Then the Epistle for the day is read, as found in the Missal; o: 
the following may be read instead: 

LESSON. Wisd. v. 1-5. The just shall stand

Behold, how they are numbered among the children of 
God, and their lot is among the saints.

Deo gratias. Thanks be to God. 

Then the Gradual, Tract, Alleluia, or Sequence, according to 
the time,

we have committed, nor punish us according to our 
iniquities. 

V. Help us, O God our Saviour; and for the glory of 
Thy name, O Lord, deliver us, and forgive us our sins for 
Thy name s sake. 

After this, at High Mass, the Deacon places the book of the Gos 
pels on the Altar, and the Celebrant blesses the incense. Then 
the Deacon, kneeling before the Altar -with joined hands, says: 
/TJUNDA cor meum ac CLEANSE my heart and

Afterwards he takes the book from the Altar, and again kneeling 
down before the Priest, asks his blessing, saying: Jube, Domine, 
benedicere. Tlie Priest says:

Amen. 

Having received the blessing, he kisses the hand of the Priest; 
and then, with incense and lighted candles, he goes to the place 
where the Gospel is read, and standing -with his hands joined, 
says: 

V. Dominus vobiscum. V. The Lord be with you 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

Then, giving out:

He makes the sign of tlw cross with the thumb of his right hand on 
the Gospel which he is to read, and on his forehead, mouth, and 
breast (the people doing the same}; and while the Minister and 
people answer: 

R. Gloria tibi, Domine. R. Glory be to Thee, O

He incenses the book three times, and then reads the Gospel.

left all things, and have followed Thee: what 
therefore shall we have ? And Jesus said to them : Amen,

Then is said: 

R. Laus tibi, Christe. R. Praise be to Thee, O

The Subdeacon then carries the book to the Priest; he kisses the 
Gospel, saying: 

ER evangelica dicta de- *!&amp;gt; Y the words of the Gos- 
leantur nostra delicta. t*&amp; pel may our sins be 
blotted out. 

Here the Sermon is usually preached. 

Then at the middle 0} the Altar, extending, elevating, and joining 
his hands, the Priest says the Nicene Creed (when it is to be 
said), keeping his hands joined. When he says the words: 
God, Jesus Christ, and: is adored, he bows his head to the cross. 
But at the words: and was incarnate, he kneels down, and con 
tinues kneeling to the words: was made man. At the words : 
the life of the world to come, he signs himself with the sign 
o) the cross jrom the forehead to the breast.

Then he kisses the Altar, and turning to the people, says: 



V. Dominus vobiscum. 
R. Et cum spiritu tuo. 



V. The Lord be with you. 
R. And with thy spirit. 



Then he says Oremus, and reads the Offertory. This being fin 
ished, the Priest takes the paten with the Host (if it is High 
Mass, the Deacon hands the Priest the paten with the Host), 
and offering it up, says: 



BUSCIPE, sancte Pater

Christians, both living and

O 



Then, making the sign of the cross with the paten, lie places the 
Host upon the corporal. The Priest pours wine and water into 
the chalice, blessing the water before it is mixed, saying: 

GOD, ! W ho, in cre 
ating human nature, 
didst wonderfully dignify it; 
and hast still more wonder 
fully renewed it; grant that, 
by the mystery of this water 
and wine, we may be made 
partakers of His divinity, Who 
vouchsafed to become par 
taker of our humanity, Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord; 
Who liveth and reigneth with 
Thee in the unity of, etc.

Amen. 



Tn Masses for the Dead, the foregoing prayer is said, but the water 
is not blessed. Then the Priest takes the chalice, and offers it, 
saying: 

/"JFFERIMUS tibi,

salvation, beseeching Thy 
clemency, that in the sight of 
Thy divine Majesty it may 
ascend with the odor of sweet 
ness, for our salvation, and 
for that of the whole world. 
Amen. 



Then he makes tlie sign of tJte cross with tJte chalice, places it upon 
the corporal, and covers it with tlie pall. Then, with his hands 
joined upon the Altar, and slightly bowing down, he says : 

(At Hih Mass, the Subdeacon here receives the paten, which he 
envelops in the extremities of tlie veil with which his shoulders 
are mantled, and then goes and stands behind the Celebrant 
iintil the conclusion of the Pater noster.)

Thee, O Lord God. 

The Priest, elevating his eyes toward heaven, and stretching out 
his hands, -which he afterward joins, makes the sign of the 
cross over the Host and chalice, while he says : 

VENI, sanctificator, om- fS"OME, O Sanctifier, al-

et bene &amp;lt;% die hoc sacrificium, and bless % this sacrifice, pre-

At High Mass, he, in the following prayer, blesses the incense:

While he gives the censer to the Deacon, he says secretly these 
words, and is afterwards incensed by the Deacon and then the 
others in order:

amoris, et flammam seternse love, and the flame of ever-

TJte Priest, with his hands joined, goes to the Epistle side of the 
Altar, where he washes his fingers as he recites the following 
verses of Ps. xxv. 

JAVABO inter innocentes 
manus meas: et cir- 
cumdabo altare tuum, Do 
mine. 

Ut audiam vocem laudis: 
et enarrem universa mira- 
bilia tua. 

Domine, dilexi decorem 



I WILL wash my hands 
among the innocent: 
and will encompass Thy altar, 
O Lord. 

That I may hear the voice 
of praise, and tell of all Thy 
marvelous works. 

I have loved, O Lord, the 

domus tuae, et locum habita- beauty of Thy house, and the 

place where Thy glory dwell- 
eth. 

Take not away my soul, O 
God, with the wicked, nor 
my life with bloody men. 

In whose hands are iniqui 
ties: their right hand is filled 
with gifts. 

As for me, I have walked 
in my innocence: redeem me, 
and have mercy upon me. 

My foot hath stood in the 
right path: in the churches I 
will bless Thee, O Lord. 

Glory be, etc. 

Returning, and bowing before the middle of the Altar, with joined 
hands, he says:

Ne perdas cum impiis,

poor sinners, and those who have never been baptized. Help 
Thy sen-ants who are trying to convert them. 

Through the wound in Thy right foot I pray for the poor, 
the sick, and the dying, and for all who are in any kind of pain, 
temptation, or trouble. - 

Through the wound in Thy left foot I beg of Thee merci 
fully to grant eternal rest to the souls of the faithful departed,

He uncovers the chalice, and makes a genuflection; then taking 
the Host in his right hand, and holding the chalice in his left, 
he signs the sign of the cross three times across the chalice, saying:

(At High Mass, the Deacon, toward the conclusion of the Pater 
Noster, goes to the right hand of the. Priest, where he awaits the 
approach of the Subdeacon, from whom he receives the paten, 
which he puts into the hands of the Priest.) 



He takes the paten between his

of the blessed and glorious 
Mary ever virgin, Mother of 
God, together with Thy 
blessed apostles Peter and 
Paul, and Andrew, and all 
the saints (making the sign 
of the cross on himself with 
the paten, he kisses it, and 
says), mercifully grant peace 
in our days: that by the 
assistance of Thy mercy we 
may be always free from sin, 
and secure from all disturb 
ance. 

He slides the paten under the Host, uncovers the chalice, and makes 
a genuflection: then rising, he lakes the Host, breaks it in tJte 
middle over the chalice, saying: 

BER eumdem Dominum ^^HROUGH the same 
nostrum Jesum Chris- &amp;gt;J Jesus Christ Thy Son

Canon of the Holy Mass. 265 

He puts the part which is in his right hand upon the paten, breaks 
a particle from the other part in his left hand, saying:

He places the half in his left hand on the paten, and holding the

his left, he says:

The preceding prayer is omitted in Masses for the Dead. 

At High Mass, the Deacon kisses the Altar, at the same time with 
the celebrating Priest, by whom he is saluted with the kiss o] 
peace -with these words: 
V. Pax tecum. V. Peace be with thee. 

To which the Deacon answers: 
R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

And then salutes in like manner the Subdeacon, who conveys the 
kiss o) peace to those amongst the Clergy who may be assisting 
at Mass.

Making a genuflection, and taking the. H &amp;gt;st in his hands, the Priest 
says: 

V Y)ANEM ccelestem acci- *T* WILL take the, bread of 
r-L piam, et nomen Do- J-% heaven, and call upon 
mini invocabo. the name of the Lord. 

Striking his breast in humility and devotion, he says thrice, the 
Acolyte ringing the bell each time: 

MINE, non sum dig- *T~^ORD, I am not worthy 

nus ut intres sub tec- * * that Thou shouldst en- 

tum meum; sed tantum die ter under my roof; say but

Taking reverently both parts of the sacred Host in his right hand, 
and making the sign of the cross with it upon himself, he says 
the following prayers: 

CORPUS Domini nostri fp| AY the body of Our Lord 

Jesu Christi custodial M- Jesus Christ preserve 

animam meam in vitam aster- my soul to life everlasting, 

nam. Amen. Amen. 

He then receives both halves of the Host, joins his hands, and re 
mains a short time in meditation on the Most Holy Sacrament. 
Then he uncovers the chalice, gathers upon the paten the small- 



272 



Canon of the Holy Mass. 



est atoms of the Host which may remain on the corporal, and 
puts them into the chalice, saying: 



QUID retribuam Domino

mini invocabo. Laudans in- 
vocabo Dominum, et ab ini-

/ A \ HAT shall I render to

hath rendered unto me? I 
will take the chalice of salva 
tion, and call upon the name 
of the Lord. Praising, I will 
call upon the Lord, and I 
shall be saved from my 
enemies. 



He takes the chalice in his right hand, and making the sign of 
the cross with it on himself, he says: 

C^ANGUIS Domini nostri JJ^HE blood of Our Lord 

.K^ 5 Jesu Christi custodial v_J Jesus Christ preserve 

animam meam in vitam aeter- my soul to everlasting life, 

nam. Amen. Amen. 

Then he receives all the blood, together with the particles in it. 

After which he communicates all who are to communicate 
(if there be any). 

Those who are to communicate go up to the Sanctuary at the Do- 
mine, non sum dignus, when the bell rings : the Acolyte says 
the Confiteor. 

Then the Priest turns to the communicants, and pronounces a 
general absolution in these words: 



/TJISEREATUR vestri om- 
r*U* nipotens Deus, et di- 
missis peccatis vestris, perdu- 
cat vos ad vitam aeternam. 

M. Amen. 

S. Indulgentiam, absolu-

M. Amen. 



V almighty God have

you your sins, and bring you

R. Amen. 

P. May the almighty and 
merciful Lord give you par 
don, absolution, and remis 
sion of your sins. 

R. Amen. 



Canon of the Holy Mass. 273 

Those who are not to communicate may here make a 
SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

Elevating a particle of the Blessed Sacrament, and turning toward 
tlie people, the Priest says: 

|q[CCE Agnus Dei, ecce *-r&amp;gt;EHOLD the Lamb of 
V^, qui tollit peccata mup -*^ God, behold Him Who 
di. taketh away th sins of the 

world. 

And then repeats three times, Domine, non sum dignus. 

Descending the steps of the Altar to the communicants, he admin 
isters the Holy Communion, saying to each: 



O OR]

animam tuam in vitam aeter- Ay soul to life everlasting 

nam. Amen. Amen. 



[ORPUS Domini nostri /T\ AY the body of Our Lord 



Here the Acolyte pours a little wine into the chalice, and the Priest 
takes the first ablution. 

QUOD ore sumpsimus, ^VRANT, Lord, that what 
Domine, pura mente &amp;gt;) we have taken with 
capiamus; et de munere tern- our mouth, we may receive 
porali fiat nobis remedium with a pure mind; and of a

to us an eternal remedy. 

Here the Acolyte pours wine and water over his fingers; and hs 
takes the second ablution. 

O ORPUS tuum, Domine, (T)AY Thy body, O Lord,

Then he wipes his mouth and the chalice, which he covers; and 
having jolded the corporal, places it on the Altar, as at first; rn 
then goes to the book, and reads the Communion: 



274 Canon of the Holy JSass. 

FOR THE COMMUNION. 

ONE thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; 
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days 
of my life. 

Taste and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man 
that hopeth in Him. 

(For a samt s day.) Blessed is that servant whom his Lord 
when He cometh shall find watching. 

If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and 
take up his cross, and follow Me. 

Then he turns to the people, and says: 

v. Y^ ^ 11 ^ 5 vobis - v - J\ HE Lord be with 

-L/ cum. V-J you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

Then he reads the Post-Communions; at the end of the first and 
last of which the Acolyte answers, Amen. 

Ajterivard he turns again toward the people, and says: 

V. Dominus vobiscum. V. The Lord be with you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit.

Then he kisses the Altar, raising his eyes, and extending, rais

BENEDICAT vos omni- (T\AY almighty God, the 

potens Deus, Pater et V-s Father, Son, 4 and 

Filius, v et Spiritus Sane- Holy Ghost, bless you. Amen,

At the word Deus, he turns toward the people, and makes the sign 
of the cross on them. Then turning to the Gospel side of the 
Altar, he says: 

V. Y^OMINUS vobis- V. JJJHE Lord be with 

\-J cum. &amp;gt;iJ you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

The Benediction is omitted in Masses for the Dead. 

He then traces the sign of the cross, first upon the Altar, and then 
upon his forehead, lips, and heart, and begins the Gospel accord 
ing to St. John, saying:

This man came for a witness, 
to give testimony of the light, 
that all men might believe 
through him. He was not 
the light, but came to give 
testimony of the light. He 
was the true light which en- 
lighteneth every man that 
cometh into this world. 

He was in the world, and 
the world was made by Him. 
and the world knew Him not. 
He came unto His own, and 
His own received Him ;iot 
But as many as received Him, 
to them He gave power to 
become the sons of God: to 
those that believe in His 
name, who are born not of 
blood, nor of the will of the 
flesh, nor of the will of man, 
but of God. AND THE WORD 
WAS MADE FLESH (here the 
people kneel down), and 
dwelt among us; and we saw 
His glory, as it were the glory 
of the Only-begotten of the 
Father, full of grace and truth. 

R. Thanks be to God. 



When a feast falls on a Sunday, or other day which has a proper 
Gospel of its own, the Gospel of the day is read instead of the

the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that 
he doth a service to God. And these things will they do to 
you, because they have not known the Father nor Me. But 
these things I have told you; that when the hour shall come, 
you may remember that I told you of them.

Eat of this celestial food; 

But with ends how opposite! 
Here tis life; and there tis 

death; 
The same, yet issuing to each 

In a difference infinite. 

Nor a single doubt retain, 
When they break the Host in 

twain, 

But that in each part remains 
What was in the whole 

before; 

Since the simple sign alone 
Suffers change in state or 

form, 

The signified remaining one 
And the same for evermore. 

Lo! upon the altar lies, 

Hidden deep from human 
eyes, 

Bread of angels from the skies, 
Made the food of mortal 
man: 

Children s meat to dogs de 
nied; 

In old types resignified; 

In the manna heaven-supplied 
Isaac, and the paschal lamb. 

Jesu! Shepherd of the sheep! 
Thou Thy flock in safety keep. 
Living bread! Thy life sup- 

p!y; 

Strengthen us, or else we die; 

Fill us with celestial grace: 

Thou, Who feedest us below! 

Source of all we have or know!

GOSP. John xix. 28-35. In illo, sclent Jesus. At that 
time: Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished 
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst. Now 
there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they put 
ting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to His 
mouth. Jesus therefore when He had taken the vinegar, 
said: It is consummated. And bowing His head, He gave 
up the ghost. Then the Jews (because it was the parasceve), 
that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the Sab 
bath-day (for that was a great Sabbath-day), besought Pilate 
that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken 
away. The soldiers, therefore, came: and they broke the 
legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him. 
But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that He 
was already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of 
the soldiers with a spear opened His side, and immediately 
there came out blood and water. And he that saw it hath 
given testimony, and his testimony is true.

nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world. When He pre 
pared the heavens, I was present: when, with a certain law 
and compass, He enclosed the depths; when He established 
the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters; when He 
compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the 
waters that they should not pass their limits; when He bal 
anced the foundations of the earth; I was with Him, form 
ing all things, and was delighted every day, playing before 
Him at all times, playing in the world: and my delights 
were to be with the children of men. Now, therefore, ye 
children, hear me: blessed are they that keep my ways. 
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed

P. COMM. Sacrificia. O Lord Jesus Christ, may the sacri

the transfixion of Thy Virgin Mother, obtain for us of Thy 
clemency every salutary blessing. 

Spiritual Communion at |Has8 

PIRITUAL communion, a practice earnestly recom- 
mended at every visit to the Blessed Sacrament, 
consists, according to St. Thomas, in an ardent desire of 
receiving Jesus Christ, and in welcoming Him with 
loving embrace, as though we received Him sacra- 
mentally. This exercise, devoutly practised, has an 
especial efficacy for inflaming us more and more with 
the fire of divine love and uniting us ever more closely 
with Christ our Lord. 

The fittest time for making spiritual communion is 
during the holy Mass, and when we visit Our Lord Jesus 
in the Blessed Sacrament. "Whenever you hear Mass," 
says St. Teresa, "endeavor also to make a spiritual 
communion, and from this you will gain the greatest

spiritual profit." The faithful who assist at the holy 
sacrifice offer, along with the priest, before the throne 
of grace, not only prayers and praises, but the sacred 
Victim also; and holy Church desires that all the faith 
ful assisting at the sacrifice should partake together 
with the priest of the most holy body of Jesus Christ. 
We find the holy Fathers most bitterly regretting the 
time when, the piety of Christians waxing cold, they 
began to give up the saintly custom of communicating 
daily at the Mass. The prayers recited by the priest in 
preparation and. thanksgiving after holy communion 
are equally adapted to the use of the faithful assisting 
at Mass. These and similar reasons show most clearly 
that if the faithful who are present at Mass can not 
communicate sacramentally, they ought at least to 
endeavor to communicate spiritually, that is, in heart 
and will. 

Christians should also make a spiritual communion 
when they visit the Most Holy Sacrament. The prin 
cipal motive for which Jesus vouchsafes to remain 
amongst us in the Blessed Sacrament is to communicate 
Himself to our souls. So great a condescension on the 
part of Our Lord requires our cooperation. But how 
can we respond to such an admirable invention of love, 
except by an ardent longing to be united to Him, and 
to receive Him into our heart at least when we find our 
selves in His sacred presence? 

In order, then, that you, O devout soul, may be well 
disposed for this holy exercise, begin by making an act 
of sincere contrition for all your sins, thus, as it were, to 
remove the dust from that chamber into which you desire 
your Lord to enter. Having done this, next excite 
yourself to a lively faith in the presence of Jesus Christ 
in this Divine Sacrament. 

Consider briefly the majesty and grandeur of that God 
Whom you behold hidden beneath the eucharistic veil; 
ponder on the strength of that love and that infinite 



308 Mass Devotions for Each Day in the Week. 

goodness which leads Him to desire earnestly to be 
united with so unworthy a creature; break forth into 
accents of humility and longing desire; of humility 
when you look upon your own unworthiness ; of desire 
when V ou behold the infinite bounty of your Lord. 
Seeing, then, that you can not now unite yourself to Him 
really by sacramental communion, join yourself to Him 
at least in heart and affection, and say to Him in words 
of burning love: "Come, my dearest Jesus, come into 
this poor heart of mine; come and satiate my desires, come 
and sanctify my soul ; come, my sweetest Jesus, come to 
my bosom; come and remain with me always." 

Imagine, then, that Mary, our most holy Mother, or 
some other of your patron saints or your good angels, 
presents to you the sacred particle; receive Him from 
their hands, clasp Him to your bosom, press Him to 
your heart; after which, breaking forth in accents of 
thanksgiving, praise, and adoration, as also of reparation, 
beseech Him to bestow upon you those graces of which 
you find yourself most in need; ask Him that you may 
always do His holy will and become a saint. 

You will thus, besides the present advantage which 
you draw from the spiritual communion, be most hap 
pily disposed to receive with increased devotion the 
real body of your adorable Redeemer, when you ap 
proach the eucharistic table. For, as wood which is 
kept warm and near the fire is the better prepared for 
burning, so a heart which is constantly kept warm with 
love towards Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is easily 
caught by the sacred flame of love when it approaches 
to that furnace of charity, ever burning in these divine 
mysteries.

WHAT THE SAINTS THOUGHT OF SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

HE Council of Trent recommends spiritual communion to 
the faithful, and St. Thomas says they are considered 



Mass Devotions J or Each Day in the Week. 309 

to be communicated spiritually, and not sacramentally, who 
desire to receive this Sacrament; so that, as Scaramelli says, 
they do not only receive Jesus spiritually, but this very Sac 
rament spiritually. St. Alphonsus, in his sweet little treatise 
on visiting the Blessed Sacrament, says that Our Lord showed 
to Sister Paula Maresca two precious vessels, one of gold and 
the other of silver, in the former of which He preserved her 
sacramental communions, and in the latter her spiritual com 
munions. Joanna of the Cross affirmed that she was often 
visited in spiritual communion with the same graces she 
received in sacramental, and, with a sigh, she exclaimed: 
"O rare method of communicating, where neither leave of con 
fessor nor of superior is needed, but only Thine, O my God! " 
The blessed Agatha of the Cross so pined with love of the 
Blessed Sacrament that it is said that she would have died 
if her confessor had not taught her the practice of spiritual 
communion, and then she used to make two hundred spiritual 
communions every day. Surin and Scaramelli both assert 
that some souls receive sometimes greater graces in a spiritual 
than in a sacramental communion; this is, of course, rare, 
and when it happens it is not through defect of the Sacrament, 
but defect of fervor in themselves. 

St. Teresa, addressing her spiritual children, says: "When 
ever, my daughters, you hear Mass and do not communicate, 
you can make a spiritual communion, which is a practice of 
exceeding profit, and you can immediately afterwards recol 
lect yourselves, just as I advised you when you communicate 
sacramentally; for great is the love of Our Lord which is in 
this way infused into the soul. For when we prepare our 
selves to receive Him, He never fails to give Himself to us 
in many modes which we comprehend not." 

We read in the life of St. Mary Magdalen of Pazzi that it 
was the custom in her monastery that when daily communion 
was hindered by the illness of the priest or any other cause, 
the nuns should communicate spiritually. The usual signal 
for communion was given in the morning, and all being 
assembled, they prayed for half an hour, and then made a 
spiritual communion. It was on one of these days that the 
saint was communicated by St. Albert the Carmelite, saying 
the "Confiteor" and the "Domine, non sum dignus," and 
doing all that she was accustomed to do when receiving com-

m union: and she afterwards declared that she had seer the 
same saint with the pyx in his hand, going to communicate 
the other nuns. Her enlarged charity ardently desired that 
others also, and especially those of her own monastery, should 
have a great hunger for that Most Holy Sacrament. 

It is said of St. Angela Merioi that when she was forbidden 
daily communion, she supplied it by fervent spiritual com 
munions in the Mass, and often felt her heart as completely 
inundated by grace as if she had made a sacramental com 
munion, and she left as one of her legacies to her Order an 
earnest recommendation of this devotion. 

Father Squillante, of the Naples Oratory, in the life erf 
Sister Mary of Santiago, of the Third Order of St. Dominic, 
which rivals Carmel as a mystical garden of delights to the 
heavenly Spouse, tells us that her love of the Blessed Sac 
rament was such that she had at last come to make a spiritual 
communion at almost every breath she drew, so that in her 
were fulfilled the words of Jeremias that in the desire of her 
heart she snuffed up the wind of her love, and that none 
turned her away. 

Nothing can show the power of spiritual communion with 
Jesus more wonderfully than the innumerable times in 
which the desire of communion has enabled the soul to 
receive the real communion by some stupendous miracle, 
as is related of St. Catharine of Sienna and other saints, and 
eminently in the case of St. Juliana of Falconieri, commu 
nicated through her breast without manducation; that is, 
her communion was real, without being either spiritual or&amp;gt; 
strictly speaking, sacramental, as theologians make man 
ducation necessary to sacramental communion. (Fr. Faber.)

AN OFFERING OF THE MASS. 

6TERNAL Father, I offer Thee this most holy and 
sublime sacrifice of the Mass, in union with Jesus

tim; in union with all the merits of His Passion; in 
union with His blessed Mother Mary, that my soul 
may be animated with the sentiments of her immaculate 
heart, when she stood at the foot of the cross; in union 
with the Church triumphant in heaven, militant on 
earth, and suffering in purgatory: i. In honor of Thy 
supreme majesty; 2. In thanksgiving for all Thy 
graces and blessings, especially for the favor of having 
called me to the religious life; 3. In satisfaction for my 
own sins, and in reparation for all the offences ever 
committed against Thee; 4. To obtain of Thy good 
ness and mercy all the graces necessary for my eternal 
salvation. 

I rejoice exceedingly that by means of this august 
sacrifice Thou shalt receive a worthy tribute of adora 
tion, thanksgiving, reparation, and prayer. And as, in 
this sacrifice, the great mystery of the cross is renewed 
for Thy glory and my sanctification, deign, O Lord, to 
apply its merits to my soul. Holy Spirit! sanctify me, 
pnrify my mind and inflame my heart with divine charity, 
so that I may live holily and die happily as a true Re 
ligious.

AT THE COXFITEOR AND KYRIE ELEISON. 



Father, look at the face of Thy Christ 
(Ps. Ixxxiii. 10) ; look at the wounds of Thy Son, 
which cry to Thee for pity. Have mercy upon me; for 
their sake pardon me the outrages that I have com 
mitted against Thee! I do not deserve to be called a 
Religious. I am a sinner, a great sinner, but I am 
sorry for all my offences. Thou art good, O my God," 
and Thy mercy is above all Thy works. 

O God, most worthy of love, and true lover of my 
soul, for the love of this, Thy Son, so beloved by Thee, 
have mercy on me. I ask Thee to give me but Thy 
love and Thy grace. Help me to do Thy holy will. 
Draw me wholly to Thyself. Burn up, O Thou con

that hinders me from belonging to Thee alone.

especially to make Thee loved by the Religious with 
whom I have the happiness of living, by zealously pray 
ing for them, by ever giving them a good example in 
obedience and detachment, and by showing in my con

praise Thee, I thank Thee, I bless Thee, I adore Thee. 
I love Thee, O my God, for Thou art good and worthy 
of all love. "What shall I render to the Lord for all

IMPLORE of Thee, O Lord, all that Thy minister 
prays for; I beseech Thee to bless our holy Father, 
the Pope, our bishops, our priests, our Community, all 
Religious, that they may do Thy will and glorify Thee; 
convert all sinners and heretics; pity those who are in 
their last agony, and have mercy on the holy souls in 
purgatory. Bless all my relatives and benefactors, 
and all those for whom I have promised to pray. Grant 
me the grace to become a holy Religious. I offer all 
these prayers to Thee, eternal Father, through Our 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



AT THE EPISTLE. 



I AM much in need of being instructed. If I thor 
oughly knew my God, the obligations of my state, 
the grandeur and the holiness of the religious life, how 
could I sin, how could I ever be lukewarm? The saints 
in heaven can not offend God. They know Him per 
fectly. Instruct me, then, O my Lord! Grant that I 
may know Thee in order that I may love Thee. Let 
me know and realize how amiable Thou art, because 
of Thy infinite perfections and Thy innumerable bene 
fits; and how ungrateful I have been in not loving Thee 
better, after having chosen Thee for my portion, in 
embracing the religious life. Honor, wealth, pleasure, 
the goods of this earth what are they, in view of death, 
and in view of the everlasting joys and rewards of heaven ? 
But I love Thee, O my God, for Thy own sake alone: 

" Not with the hope of gaining aught, 
Not seeking a reward; 
But, as Thyself hast loved me 
O ever-loving Lord."

With St. Francis of Assisi, I pray: "May I die tc

to die for love of me! " 



AT THE GOSPEL. 

OMY Jesus! Thou art my Master, Thou art the 
sovereign truth, Thou art the true light that has 
come down from heaven to enlighten those who sit in 
darkness. Speak: I am Thy servant, and I listen for 
the purpose of knowing and obeying Thy will. What 
wilt Thou have me to do ? I am ready to do all things. 
But, alas! I know what I have to do. Thou com- 
mandest me to renounce my will, to carry my cross 
every day of my life, to follow Thee by endeavoring to 
imitate Thee. Thou requirest me to love Thee, and to 
love my neighbor as myself for the love of Thee. Thou 
wishes! me to testify my love to Thee, in combating my 
inclinations, in observing Thy holy commandments 
with fidelity, and in fulfilling the counsels of Thy Gos 
pel. How can I hesitate? I hive already promised 
it, I have bound myself to it. I renew my vows. Alas! 
I regret that I have not been faithful to them! With 
the powerful aid of Thy grace, J shall be faithful, most 
faithful, to the Holy Rule. 

AT THE CREDO. 

I BELIEVE in Thee, O my God! I believe all Thou 
hast taught by Thy holy Church, because Thou 
hast promised to preserve it from all error. I believe 
in it most firmly, because Thou art Truth itself, Who 
neither canst deceive nor be deceived. Gladly would 
I shed my blood for this faith! 

I believe in Thee, O adorable Trinity, Father, Son, 
and Holy Ghost ! I believe in Thee, O only-begotten 
Son of the Father! I believe that Thou becamest man; 
that Thou didst suffer and die for my salvation. I

believe that Thou art in heaven, and in the Most Holy 
Sacrament of the Altar, where Thou intercedest for me. 
Increase my faith, and deign to enlighten those who 
are in the darkness of error. 

And do Thou, O Holy Ghost, Whom I adore as my 
true God, receive my heartfelt thanks for the consola 
tion and the strength which come to my soul through 
the Bread of life and the holy sacrifice. I offer Thee 
my whole heart, O Holy Spirit, divine Consoler, and 
thank Thee most heartily for all the benefits that Thou 
dost unceasingly bestow upon the world. I beseech 
Thee to bless me with a lively faith in the Holy Eucha 
rist. Keep my soul ever bright for the corning of the 
Bridegroom. Grant me Thy sevenfold gift, in order 
that I may with ardent love follow Christ, and with 
perseverance walk in the way of salvation. 

AT THE OFFERTORY AND LAVABO. 

OMY God! would that I were able to offer Thee 
something worthy of Thy divine majesty and of 
Thy innumerable benefits. Of myself I have nothing, 
and yet what I shall offer Thee is a treasure of infinite 
value; it is Thy only Son Jesus Christ, the object of 
Thy complacency. I offer Him, then, to Thee, O 
great God! I offer to Thee all His virtues, all His 
sentiments, all His words, all His actions, all His 
prayers, all His fasts, all His tears, all His sufferings, 
all the drops of His blood, all His adorable mysteries. 
I offer all the merits of the august Virgin, of the 
saints of heaven, of the souls in purgatory, and of the 
just on earth. In union with Jesus, I offer Thee all 
that I am, and all that I have: my soul, my body, my 
senses, my thoughts, my desires, my words, my actions, 
my sufferings, my labors, my life, and my death. I 
desire no longer to belong to myself. I am Thine and 
Thine forever. What an anomaly is a Religious who 
is not Thine, O Lord! As this bread is about to be

changed into the body of Jesus Christ, so change me, O 
Lord! convert me, and cause me to become a holy Re 
ligious. 

O Lord, Thou art sanctity itself, and I belong to 
Thee; there should be no stain in me. Purify me, 
wash me in the blood of Jesus Christ, my Saviour; let 
grief and anguish wound my heart; let me never again 
be separated from Thee by sin. 

AT THE ORATE FRATRES AND SECRETA. 

r\ LORD, we join our prayers to those of the priest 
^^ at the altar. God of infinite sanctity, grant that 
he may be invested with that holiness which Thou dost 
look for in Thy ministers. Bless him, that he may be 
a man according to Thine own Heart. May this clean 
oblation, which he is offering, be acceptable to Thee; 
may it be for the glory of Thy name, for the sanctifica- 
tion of my soul, and for the welfare of Thy Church. 
Give me, O Lord, the innocence and simplicity of a child, 
so that I may merit Thy fatherly favors and blessings!

all sinners, and may the just obtain the grace of per

relations and those who have authority over me, my 
benefactors and those who have asked my prayers, those 
who have offended me and whom I have offended. 
May the Community to which I have the honor of be 
longing, be always dear to Thee, and cease not to re 
ceive from Thee abundant blessings. Thou canst do 
all things, O Lord! Make, then, of us as many saints 
as we are Religious. 

At this moment I have need of being profoundly 
recollected. Jesus is about to descend on the altar; 
there He will perform the office of Mediator for me. 
He will pay for me the heavy debt I have contracted to 
divine justice. Come, O Lord Jesus! come, O Spouse 
of my soul ! Let me taste the sweetness of Thy presence. 
O my soul, behold thy King! Behold, He comes to thee 
full of tenderness and compassion! He veils the splen

crown of the saints! How meekly, how humbly hast 
Thou come to us, good Lord! 

Profoundly I adore Thee, and bless Thee, and praise 
Thee! 

And what dost Thou ask of me, my Lord, in Thy 
great condescension? 

Only my heart. Praise and honor are pleasing to 
Thee only when they spring from pure hearts; there 
fore I beseech Thee, O Jesus, by Thy infinite purity 
and holiness, to cleanse my heart more and more from 
every stain of sin and every evil inclination. Give me 
the heart of a perfect Religious, pure, unselfish, and 
entirely devoted to Thy interests. Take my heart into 
Thy Sacred Heart, that it may there be purified, like gold 
in the furnace, from the dross of worldly attachments 
and sensual desires. Thou hast said: "I am come to 
cast fire on the earth, and what do I desire but that it 
be enkindled ? " Mav my heart, O Lord, respond to

the intensity of Thy love. I love Thee, and I desire to 
love Thee daily more and more. O Sacred Heart of 
Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, sanctify my heart, 
make it like to Thine, that it may be pleasing to Thee, 
and that I may remain united with Thee for ever. Have 
mercy, also, on the poor, holy souls in purgatory; wash 
them, cleanse them in that precious blood which Thou 
didst shed upon the cross and which is now here present 
on the altar. 

Be to them a merciful and kind Samaritan, and heal 
with Thy sacred blood, which is indeed a heavenly oil, 
their burning wounds. O adorable Jesus, look down 
with pity upon these poor, suffering souls. They loved 
Thee whilst they lived on earth; they repent and lament 
that they were guilty of grieving and offending Thee, 
and they ardently long to love Thee more perfectly and 
to praise Thee unceasingly in heaven. 

Oh, do Thou satisfy their longing desires to behold 
Thee face to face, and in Thine infinite mercy deliver 
them from their terrible sufferings and receive them 
into Thine eternal kingdom. 

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord! And let per 
petual light shine upon them.

as the angels and saints do it in heaven. Give us this 
day our daily bread; take this religious house under Thy 
special protection, O Lord. Forgive us our trespasses, 
as ive forgive those who trespass against us. 

I love without exception, for the love of Thee, all my 
enemies, and all for whom I have had any antipathy. 
Remember, O Lord! that Thou hast said, "Pardon, 
and you shall be pardoned." Lead us not into tempta 
tion. O my God! do not allow me to be tempted, or. 
if I shall be tempted, let me not yield to the temptation. 
Remove from me the occasions of sin, and come to my 
assistance, in order that I may not expose myself to it. 
Deliver us from evil. Sin is the greatest of all evils; 
purify me from those I have committed, and suffer me 
not to commit any more. After life, preserve me from 
hell, so often deserved by me for my sins; and even from 
purgatory, where the souls therein detained, undergo 
most cruel torments in seeing themselves separated 
from Thee. Amen. May it be so. I implore all these 
things with fervor, through the merits of Jesus Christ, 
for myself, for all Religious, for all the faithful. 

AT THE AGNUS DEI. 

Lamb of God! Who hast condescended to be im-

bless me with those dispositions which the reception of 
the Most Adorable Sacrament requires, so that when I 
shall approach the holy table, I may do so in a manner 
most agreeable to Thee, and most salutary to myself. 
I conjure Thee to purify my heart, to come and dwell 
therein, until the day that I shall have the happiness to 
receive Thy sacred body in the Blessed Sacrament. 
Come, Lord Jesus; come to me at least spiritually; I 
love Thee with my whole heart. Come, give me, if not 
Thy sacred flesh, at least Thy love, Thy grace, Thy 
spirit, Thy heart; grant that I may be transformed into 
Thee; and that I may live Thy life.

is presenting to you the sacred Host. Keep closely united 
to Jesus Christ, as if you had really received Him, and say 
in thanksgiving:

myself in union with Jesus Christ, to honor Thy Majesty, 
to thank Thee for Thy benefits, to appease Thy justice, 
to draw down on myself, and all this Community, and 
on Thy Church, those graces which Thou seest are 
necessary for us. Oh! how happy am I in being con

so many dangers present themselves! In religion, I have 
only to please Thee, the God of my heart. Keep me, 
Lord, keep me in Thy Heart! O Sacred Heart of Jesus, 
most obedient to Thy Father s will, turn our hearts to

Thyself, that we may ever do those things which are 
pleasing to Thee. O heart of Mary, Mother of Jesus, 
and my Mother, keep me, guard me as thine own, help 
me, that I may imitate thy virtues, and thus become 
ever more pleasing to thy divine Son. 

AT THE BLESSING. 

\ MOST august Trinity! now that Thy minister 
^-^ is about to bless me in Thy name, pour out on 
me Thy most abundant benedictions. Bless me now; 
bless me every day of my life, and at the moment of my 
death; bless all those with whom I have the happiness 
of living, in order that we may never cease to sing, one 
day, canticles of praise and love to Thy mercy and Thy 
glory, in that kingdom which Thou hast prepared for 
us in Thy boundless love. 



IN CONCLUSION. 



"T CANNOT leave Thy temple, O Lord, without 
** expressing to Thee my gratitude fcr the great 
blessings and holy inspirations that have come to me 
through this Mass. My God, I thank Thee with all 
my heart. Love for love, eternal love for Thy bound 
less love to me. Pardon, O Lord, the coldness and dis 
tractions of which I have been guilty during the holy 
sacrifice. I am sorry for these offences, and for all the 
sins of my whole life, because Thou art infinitely good 
and sin displeases Thee; henceforth I shall endeavor 
more earnestly to please Thee in all things. 

I leave for a time, dear Jesus, this place of benedic 
tions which Thou hast chosen for Thy dwelling; yet, 
though I can not be always bodily present in this holy 
place, to commune with Thee in the Sacrament of Thy 
love, I shall ever be there in thought and desire, and I 
shall return with joy as soon as possible, for my delight 
s to be before Thy altars. Let me not forget Thee

during my occupations. I consecrate all my work to 
Thee; I wish by it to please Thee alone. My watch 
word shall be: "Ad major em Dei gloriam et in honor em 
Beata Maria Virginis!" Give me Thy grace,, that I 
may do Thy will and love Thee daily more and more. 
O my Well-Beloved! O Sacred Heart of Jesus! O ten 
der Spouse of my soul! have mercy on me. Keep me 
near Thee; draw me ever closer to Thee. O Mary, my 
good Mother, I implore thy protection. Angels and 
saints of heaven, intercede for this poor unworthy hand 
maid of the Lord, who hopes one day to be associated 
with you in glory.

method is intended for those who prefer meditation 
to the recital of vocal prayers. 
The Mass is divided into four parts: the first, from the 
beginning to the Gospel; the second, to the Elevation; the 
chird, to the Communion of the priest; and the fourth to 
the end. 



324 Method of Hearing Mass by 

In the first part we may consider and honor the Heart of 
Jesus, praying in His agony at the approach of His Passion, 
especially in the Garden of Olives. 

In the second we honor the Heart of Jesus humbled and 
suffering in the various tribunals of Jerusalem, until the 
time of the scourging at the pillar. 

In the third we honor the Heart of Jesus suffering in the 
scourging and crowning with thorns, and follow Him in the 
path of suffering until His last sigh on the cross. 

In the fourth we honor the Heart of Jesus hidden and 
buried in the sepulcher. 

This manner of hearing has four very precious advan 
tages: The priest is followed throughout the sacrifice, which is 
a very holy and meritorious way of assisting at Mass. The 
Heart of Jesus is honored in every stage of His Passion. We 
enter into the interior sentiments of His adorable Heart and 
endeavor to make them our own. 

The Mass thus becomes a prayer, and at the same time a 
very useful and salutary meditation.

The Heart o] Jesus Praying and Suffering. 

prayest, Thou dost suffer, O my sweet Saviour, 



Thy Heart experiencing a mortal sadness ; suffer me 
to unite myself to Thy sorrows, and give me a share in 
Thy deep affliction. Everything that presented itself 
to Thy mind plunged Thy Heart in a sea of bitterness; 
for Thou didst behold the deplorable state of the world, 
the crimes and excesses of mankind, the torrent of iniqui 
ties which deluged the earth, the multitude of souls which 
would perish and be cast into hell, the glory of Thy 
heavenly Father, outraged, the reproach of Thy Passion 
and sufferings, and their uselessness with regard to so 
many sinners, who, notwithstanding the shedding of 
Thy blood for them, would be lost for ever. 



Way of Meditation on ike Passion, 325 

my Saviour, am I not also a cause of sorrow to 
Thee? Thou lamentest over me, Thou seest the sad 
state of my soul, my tepidity and negligence, my unfaith 
fulness and resistance to Thy grace, the little sorrow I 
have conceived, my little care for amendment, the dan 
ger to which I am exposed of dying in so sad a state. 
Thou lamentest all this, and I am not touched; Thou 
art afflicted, and I am insensible. Heart of my God, 
Thou prayest and I know not how to pray; if I pray, 
it is with so little attention, fervor, or devotion, that my 
prayers deserve not to ascend to the throne of Thy 
mercy. My God, teach me how to pray, that at least, 
in virtue of Thy sacrifice which I offer Thee, my prayer 
may be pleasing in Thy sight. Yes, my God, in this 
holy confidence I offer Thee the homage of prayer for 
the salvation of my soul, whose misery and extreme 
necessity Thou knowest. 

1 beseech Thee also to remember all those for whom 
I ought to pray my relations, that we may be united 
much more strongly by the bonds of grace than by those 
of blood; my friends, that Thou mayest be the bond and 
center of our friendship; my benefactors, beseeching 
Thee to render them a hundredfold the goods which I 
have received; and the vengeance which I desire for my 
enemies is, that Thou wouldst visit them with Thy 
graces. I pray to Thee also, in a particular manner, 
my God, for the Church, my tender mother, for the 
Sovereign Pontiff, and all Religious. Shed over all Thy 
abundant benedictions; give to all of us hearts accord 
ing to Thy Heart, uniting us all in the same holy fellow 
ship. Bless in particular our own Religious Community. 

Heart of Jesus, praying and suffering, I adore thee, 
and beseech thee to unite my prayers with thine. 

Heart of Jesus, lamenting and agonizing, I adore 
thee, and beseech thee to inspire my heart with the 
same sentiments.

FROM THE GOSPEL TO THE ELEVATION. 

The Heart 0} Jesus Humbled and Annihilated. 

/"\ MY sweet Saviour! with what floods of bitterness 
^ is not Thy Sacred Heart deluged! With what 
torrents of humiliation is it not overwhelmed! Led, or 
rather dragged from tribunal to tribunal, from one indig 
nity to another, before judges who are Thy enemies., 
tied and bound as a slave, accused as a criminal, Thou 
art judged and condemned as a malefactor, a seducer, a 
disturber of the public peace. 

At the house of Caiphas Thou art given up to insults, 
and the injuries and affronts of a troop of soldiers, who 
make Thee undergo the most infamous treatment. 

Before Annas Thy face is dishonored by a shameful 
blow, the most audacious outrage that can be perpe 
trated amongst men. 

By Herod Thou art covered with a white robe in sign 
of mockery. Thou art treated as a fool before his whole 
court, who turn into contempt and insult the esteem and 
admiration of which Thou hast been the object. 

By Pilate Thou art placed on a level with a robber and 
a malefactor, and Thou hast the sorrow to see this infa 
mous wretch preferred before Thee. 

Dragged through the streets of Jerusalem, Thou wast 
obliged to undergo the yells, the cries, and imprecations 
of the immense populace there assembled, who load 
Thee with curses and maledictions. O King of glory, 
what a flood of humiliations overwhelmed Thy Heart! 
but what marvellous virtue Thou dost display! what 
meekness, what patience, and charity! Thou dost pray 
for those who outrage Thee. Thou offerest Thy suffer 
ings for those who persecute and afflict Thee. 

O adorable Saviour, this sacrifice of Thy Heart was 



War of Meditation on the Passion. 327 

necessary in order to repair the glory of Thy outraged 
Father, to humble the proud exaltation of our minds, 
to confound the detestable pride with which our hearts 
ire swelled, to make us know the inestimable value of 
humiliations, to give us in Thy Passion a touching ex 
ample to which we can have nothing to oppose. Even 
on our very altars, to what a condition dost Thou reduce 
Thyself for the love of us! And yet, O my God, how 
astonishing and deplorable it is, that notwithstanding 
so striking an example, pride should still hold dominion 
over us; for, alas! how much of vanity, self-love, and 
sensitiveness do we not possess! 

My divine Saviour, how much have I not to reproach 
myself with on this point! I seek only the applause and 
esteem of men, as if Thine were not sufficient. I can 
suffer and endure nothing for Thee, Who hast under 
gone so much for me; the least humiliation afflicts and 
dejects me; my spirit is rebellious, my heart swells, my 
whole soul is disturbed and agitated; a cowardly and 
worthless human respect makes me betray my duty and 
Thy interests. Oh, how can I call myself Thy disciple, 
and acknowledge Thee for my Master and my God? 
Was it necessary, then, O my Saviour and my Lord, 
that Thou alone shouldst drink of the chalice of 
humiliations? No, my adorable Master, I will share 
it with Thee, I will receive it from Thy hands, I will 
have a part in Thy abasements; and if I have not the 
courage to meet humiliations, I will at least accept with 
submission those which Thou shalt send me. From 
henceforth I offer Thee the sacrifice of my pride and my 
vanity, in order to unite myself to Thee in Thy annihila 
tions. 

If nature rebels, or self-love complains, I will follow 
Thy example and implore Thy grace. This divine^ ex 
ample, drawn from Thy Heart and passing into mine, 
will render the chalice of Thy humiliations precious, 
even consoling to me, and one drop of its bitterness will 



328 Method of Hearing Mass by 

be sweeter to me than all the deceitful and guilty pleas 
ures of this blind and perverse world. 

O Heart of Jesus, saturated with indignities, make 
me share in thy chalice. 

O Heart of Jesus, steeped in an ocean of sorrows, 
steep my heart in thy tears. 

O Heart of Jesus, plunged in an abyss of humiliations 
and suffering, destroy my self-love and pride. 

FROM THE ELEVATION TO THE COMMUNION OF THE 
PRIEST. 

The Heart of Jesus Suffering and Expiring on the Cross. 

*AS it necessary, O my Jesus, that, after having 
given up Thy Sacred Heart to the greatest humili 
ations, Thy body should be delivered to excessive tor 
ments? To what a condition art Thou reduced by the 
terrible scourging! Thy body is bruised, torn, and covered 
with wounds. Thou art bathed in the streams of Thy 
adorable blood, and yet they cease not to strike Thee, 
and to exercise over Thee all the fury, cruelty, and hatred 
of which they are capable. 

But, O my God, in the midst of these excessive suffer 
ings of Thy body, what are the emotions of Thy Heart ? 

Thou dost suffer with patience, O sweet Saviour, 
submitting Thyself to Thy heavenly Father, offering to 
Him Thy torments, begging of Him the forgiveness of 
our sins, regarding Thyself as a victim sacrificed for our 
salvation, beholding those streams of blood with resig 
nation, and even with joy, in order that our sins might 
be washed away, and that the voice of this adorable 
blood, rising even to heaven, might obtain grace and 
mercy for us. 

Tboii sufferest everything for me, O adorable Heart 
of my Saviour, and yet the least suffering is a torment 
to me; I fear even the very name of suffering and pain. 
I care so much for mv body, seeking its ease and guard- 



Way of Meditation on the Passion. 329 

ing it so carefully, without remembering that it is a body 
of sin, which I ought to subject to the rigors of penance. 
Ah! my Saviour, do I not see that by my care in avoid 
ing suffering I increase Thine, rendering those suffer 
ings useless for my salvation? 

All Thy sufferings in this cruel scourging, O my 
Saviour, nevertheless are little else than the commence 
ment of Thy torments. Thy sacrifice must be consum 
mated. I behold Thee loaded with Thy cross, taking 
the way to Calvary. Suffer me, O my God and Saviour, 
to follow Thee in spirit, and step in Thy bleeding foot 
steps. What do I see, great God, what marvelous 
spectacle does faith present to me? A suffering God! a 
dying God ! a God dying in excess of pain ! a God dying 
for the love of those who cause His death! At such a 
sight what can I say; how can my heart express the sen 
timents with which it is filled? 

Ah! my Saviour, how eloquently dost Thou preach 
upon Thy cross the great truths of faith which Thou hast 
announced to us! How dost Thou make known the 
greatness of the inexorable justice of God, the excellence 
and the price of our souls, but, above all, the malice 
and enormity of sin, the severity and horror of the punish 
ments which are reserved for it in eternity. And they 
are my sins, O Heart of my God, which Thou bewailest, 
which Thou dost lament upon the cross. They are my 
sins which led Thee there, which fastened Thee to its 
wood, which have shed Thy sacred blood, and caused 
Thy death; and I, my Saviour, am not filled with sor 
row at the foot of Thy cross. Should I not weep with 
sorrow for having offended my God, caused the suffer 
ings of Jesus, rendered myself responsible for His blood, 
and guilty of His death ? Thy Heart is still open for me 
upon Thy cross, O Jesus. Thy arms are extended ten 
derly to receive me, and I return to Thee with sincerity 
and sorrow. 

Every day Thou renewest on our altars, in an un- 



330 Mass by Way of Meditation on the Passion. 

bloody manner, the bloody sacrifice which Thou didst 
once offer upon Calvary. It is this sacrifice that I offer 
Thee, as Thou didst offer it to Thy heavenly Father. 
Suffer me to unite to Thy sacrifice the sacrifice of myself, 
and especially that of a contrite and humble heart. I 
beg of Thee to give me a heart broken with sorrow to 
offer to Thee, and thus render the victim worthy of 
Thee, worthy to be sacrificed to Thee. 

FROM THE COMMUNION OF THE PRIEST TO THE END OF 

MASS. 

The Heart of Jesus Concealed and Buried in the Sepulcher. 

BELOVED Saviour, Thy body is placed in the 
sepulcher, the last of the humiliations which 
Thou hadst to undergo in this world, for humiliation was 
to accompany Thee even to the tomb. O my soul, what 
a state of abasement for God made man is this, to be in 
the world as not there, hidden in the bosom of the earth, 
surrounded by the shades of death, given up to obscurity 
in the region of darkness, absolutely destitute of every 
thing, for even the tomb in which Jesus reposes is not His, 
thus verifying the words He had said of Himself: "The 
birds of the air have their nests; but the Son of man 
hath not where upon to lay His head." Yet in this 
state of humiliation Thou, my Jesus, dost preserve all 
Thy power. 

Behold, my soul, the great example given us for our 
imitation. St. Paul tells us that we are dead, that our 
life must be "hidden with Jesus Christ in God." Yes, 
my divine Saviour, in Thy tomb I will learn detachment 
from the world, forgetfulness of the world, death to the 
world and to myself, the nothingness of earthly things, 
the love of retirement, and strict union with God; for 
Thou shalt take the place of all, O Jesus, when for Thee 
I have quitted all with heart and mind. 

O my God, vouchsafe to accept these resolutions; I 



Holy Mass in Union with the Sacrea fteari. 331 

renew them in this holy sacrifice, and I offer them to 
Thee in union with Thine own. I beg of Thee to give 
me the grace to preserve them in my soul as long as I 
live, and grant that I may persevere in them until death. 

O adorable Heart of my Saviour, Thou wast not always 
in humiliation, suffering, and sorrow. After so many 
trials and conflicts, Thou didst ascend into heaven, the 
conqueror of Thy enemies; triumphing over the world, 
death, and all the powers of hell, Thou art exalted in 
glory, and seated at the right hand of the heavenly 
Father. 

Heart of my God, I rejoice in Thy glory and Th^ 
triumph. Shall I one day share Thy glory and Thy 
happiness? It is only through Thee and Thy merits 
that I can hope for and merit this grace. I beseech 
Thee to give it me in virtue of the sacrifice which I offer 
Thee. Thou hast offered Thyself for me upon our 
altars; receive me one day in Thy sacred tabernacle, in 
order that I may praise Thee for ever with Thy elect; 
and as a pledge of this happiness, vouchsafe to ratify 
in heaven the blessing which Thy priest gives us on 
earth, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Ghost. Amen.

T that time, Jesus, knowing that all things were 
now accomplished that the Scripture might be 
fulfilled, said: I thirst. Now there was a vessel set 
there full of vinegar. And they putting a sponge full 
of vinegar about hvssop, put it to His mouth. Jesus, 



the Sacred Heart of Jesus. 335 

therefore, when He had taken the vinegar, said: It is 
consummated. And bowing His head, He gave up the 
ghost. Then the Jews (because it was the parasceve) 
that the, bodies might not remain upon the cross on the 
Sabbath-day (for that was a great Sabbath-day) besought 
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they 
might be taken away. The soldiers therefore came : and 
they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was 
crucified with him. But after they were come to Jesus, 
when they saw that He was already dead, they did not 
break His legs. But one of the soldiers with a spear 
opened His side, and immediately there came out blood 
and water. And he that saw it hath given testimony; 
and his testimony is true. (John xix. 28-35.) 

AT THE CREDO. 

I BELIEVE, O my God, the truths which Thou hast 
revealed to Thy Church. I desire to live and die 
in this faith. Grant, O Lord, that my life may be con

by good works; and that, in particular, I may live in 
imitation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, according to the 
spirit of my vows. Sweet Heart of Jesus, Thy kingdom

obedience, poverty, and chastity. Jesus, meek and

GOD, infinitely holy, if my sins provoke Thee r 
and make me hateful in Thy sight, look upor, 
the Lamb without spot, that taketh away the sins of 
the world, and, beholding His merits, remember not 
my ingratitude. Behold the Sacred Heart of Thy 
divine Son! This Heart, infinitely merciful, prayed for 
me on Calvary, and will soon renew the sacrifice of 
itself for me upon the altar. Eternal Father, I offer Thee 
the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, in satis-

faction for my sins and for the wants of the holy Catho 
lic Church. 

Remember, O good and gentle Jesus, that none who 
had recourse to Thy Sacred Heart, implored its assistance, 
or cried for pardon, were ever abandoned. Animated 
with this confidence in Thy goodness and mercy, O 
Divine Heart, and groaning beneath the weight of my 
iniquities, I prostrate myself before Thee. Have pity 
on me, and listen to my prayers. Our Father in heaven. 
Who has deigned to give Thee to us for our salvation, will, 
through Thee, and united with Thee, receive our prayers. 
Through Thy merits we hope to obtain the pardon of 
our sins, the special graces that we ask for now, and, 
above all, the grace of perseverance, that with the angels 
and saints we may praise Thee now on earth, and bless- 
Thee for ever in heaven. 

O sweetest Heart of Jesus, I implore, 
That I may ever love Thee more and more. 

AT THE MEMENTO OF THE LIVING.

Heart, wounded for love of us, we beseech Thee to pro

spouse of Thy divine Son. Bless His Holiness, our chief 
Pastor, our bishops, and our priests. 

Remember also, O Lord, my parents, my relatives, 
my friends, my benefactors, and all those who have 
asked me to pray for them, and for whom I have prom 
ised to pray. Bless them, and by Thy grace advance 
them in the way of salvation. 

O good and loving Jesus, take to Thy Sacred Heart all

unfortunately do not love Thee. 

AT THE ELEVATION. 

Cast a look of adoration and love upon the sacred Host 
when it is elevated by the priest; then incline your head 
devoutly and say: 

I SEE upon the altar placed 
The Victim of the greatest love; 
Let all the earth below adore, 

And join the heavenly choirs above: 
Sweet Sacrament, we Thee adore. 
Oh! make us love Thee more and more. 

Jesus! dear Pastor of the flock, 

That crowds in love about Thy feet, 

Our voices yearn to praise Thee, Lord, 
And joyfully Thy presence greet: 

Sweet Sacrament, we Thee adore. 

Oh! make us love Thee more and more.

AT THE MEMENTO OF THE DEAD. 

O FATHER of mercies, in the name of Thy beloved 
Son, in memory and in virtue of the wound of 
His Sacred Heart, His bitter Passion, and His cruel 
death, in consideration also of the dolors of the immacu 
late heart of Mary, of all the loving transports of the

saints, and of all the torments of the martyrs, I beseech 
Thee to have pity on the souls of the faithful departed; 
particularly on the souls of our friends, relatives, bene 
factors, and the associates of the League of the Sacred 
Heart. Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord, and may 
perpetual light shine upon them. O Jesus, mercy! 
Blessed be Thy Sacred Heart, and may Thy precious 
blood, shed for us in Thy Passion, obtain for us that 
heavenly inheritance, where we shall dwell with Thee 
in honor and glory, and bless Thee for ever. 

AT THE PATER NOSTER. 

Recite slowly and devoutly the sublime prayer which 
Jesus Himself taught His disciples. Surely nothing better can 
be substituted here. 

/"\UR Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy 
^-^ name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven; give us this day our daily

but deliver us from evil. Amen. 

AT THE COMMUNION.

I looked for one that would grieve together with

SPIRITUAL COMMUNION.* 

good Lord, my dear Jesus! I am sorry for hav- 
ing wounded Thy loving Heart by my sins, 
because Thou art infinitely good, and sin displeases 

* This Mass in honor of the Sacred Heart may be used profit 
ably, whenever we assist at the holy sacrifice; hence an act of 
spiritual communion is here inserted for those days on which 
fve do not approach the holy table 



340 The Holy Mass in Union with 

Thee. Like the beloved disciple, let me rest upon Thy 
Heart, and let me grieve, together with Thee, for the 
outrages that are committed against Thee in the Sacra 
ment of Thy love. I give Thee my heart and my love, 
if my poor love can comfort Thee. I love Thee above 
all things, and I desire to possess Thee within my soul. 
Since I am unable now to receive Thee sacramentally, 
come at least spiritually into my heart, and nourish my 
soul unto life everlasting. Let my soul, O Lord, feel 
Thy sweetness. Let me taste how sweet Thou art, O 
Lord, that, being allured by Thy love, I may never sin 
by running passionately after worldly pleasures. "Thou 
art the God of my heart, and the God that is my por 
tion for ever." Oh, Thou Lamb of God, Who takest 
away the sins of the world, take away from me what 
ever may hurt me and displease Thee. Give me but 
Thy love and Thy grace! May the sweet flame of Thy 
love consume my soul, that so I may die to the world 
for the love of Thee, as Thou hast vouchsafed to die 
upon the cross for the love of me. 

PRAYERS AFTER COMMUNION. 

BEING fed with peaceful delights and life-giving 
sacraments, we suppliantly beseech Thee, O 
Lord our God, that Thou, Who art meek and humble 
of heart, wouldst make us clean from the stain of every 
vice, and cause us to abhor more steadfastly the vanities 
of the world. 

AY we be renewed, O Lord, by the sacred mysteries 
we have received; and may they expiate our 
sins, and prepare us for Thy eternal mercies. Amen. 

AT THE BLESSING. 

BLESSED be the Sacred Heart of Jesus! Bless us, 
O Lord, as Thou didst bless the little children, 



the Sacred Heart of fesus. 34 1 

and again Thy disciples at Thy glorious ascension into 
heaven, so that we may persevere in Thy grace, and be 
numbered on the last day among the elect, whom Thou 
wilt call the blessed of Thy Father, and invite into Thy 
eternal kingdom. 

AT THE LAST GOSPEL. 

V. The beginning of the holy Gospel, according to St. John, 
R. Glory be to Thee, O Lord. 

"T*N the beginning was the Word, and the Word was 
-- with God, and the Word was God: the same was 
in the beginning with God. All things were made by 
Him, and without Him was made nothing that was 
made: in Him was life and the life was the light of men: 
and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did 
not comprehend it. There was a man sent from God, 
whose name was John. This man came for a witness 
to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe 
through him. He was not the light, but was to give 
testimony of the light. That was the true light which 
enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world. He 
was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and 
the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and 
His own received Him not. But as many as received 
Him, He gave them power to be made the sons of God: 
to them that believe in His name, who are born, not of 
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, 
but of God. AND THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH (here 
the people kneel), and dwelt among us: and we saw His 
glory, the glory as it were of the Only-begotten of the 
Father, full of grace and truth. 
R. Thanks be to God.

MAKE YOUR INTENTION. 

GOD of all mercy, I come to offer Thee the blood 
of the Lamb without spot, for the souls which 
Thou lovest, and which long and sigh for the blessed 
ness of seeing Thee and glorifying Thee in heaven. 
Just, indeed, are Thy punishments; yet, we beseech 
Thee, open to them this day the boundless treasure of 
the satisfaction of Thy divine Son; and bestow upon 
them in this holy sacrifice wherewithal to discharge 
the debt which they still owe to Thy sovereign justice. 

If you intend to communicate, and wish to offer your 
communion for particular souls, say: 

I beseech Thee, O Lord, to apply to the souls of N.N. 
the indulgences which I hope to be able to obtain by 
the communion I am about to receive. 

A PRAYER BEFORE MASS. 

ETERNAL God, Who, besides the general pre- 
cepts of charity, hast commanded a particular 
respect to be shown to parents, priests, kindred, and 
benefactors, and by the institution of the sacrifice of 
the Mass hast left us the means of testifying our love 
and gratitude toward them even after death, vouchsafe 
that the Mass I this day offer in union with Thy minister, 
for the souls of N.N. may shorten their sufferings, if 
they be still detained in the purifying flames of purgatory. 
As there may be many of my friends, relatives, bene 
factors, spiritual or temporal, or ancestors, tormented in 
these, intense flames, who were the instruments of Thy 
providence in bestowing on me existence, education, and 
innumerable other blessings, grant that I may be the 



For the Faithful Departed. 343 

means of obtaining for them a speedy release from their 
excessive sufferings, and a free admittance to Thy eter 
nal joys; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 



AT THE BEGINNING OF MASS. 

S-\ ALMIGHTY God, with Whom the spirits of the 
^^ just live, and in Whose holy custody are deposited 
the souls of all that depart hence in an inferior degree of 
grace, and are therefore detained in a state of suffering; 
as we bless Thee for the saints already admitted into 
Thy glory, so we humbly offer up our prayers for the 
afflicted souls who continually sigh after the days of 
their deliverance. 

If among them be the souls of those for whom we this 
day petition, vouchsafe to pardon their sins, that they 
may behold Thee, and in Thy glorious light eternally 
rejoice. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

INTROIT. 

^fRANT them, O Lord, eternal rest, and let per- 
*&amp; petual light shine upon them. Ps. A hymn 
becometh Thee, O Lord, in Sion, and a vow shall be 
paid to Thee in Jerusalem; hear my prayer; all flesh 
shall come to Thee. Grant them, etc. 

Lord, have mercy on them. 

Christ, have mercy on them. 

Lord, have mercy on them. 

COLLECTS. 

GOD, Whose property is always to have mercy 
and to spare, we humbly beseech Thee for the 
soul of Thy servant N., that Thou wouldst not deliver 
it up into the hands of the enemy, nor forget it unto the 
end, but command it to be received by Thy holy angels, 
and to be carried to paradise, its true country, that, as 



344 ^ Mode of Hearing Mass 

in Thee it hoped and trusted, it may not have to endure 
the pains of hell, but come to the possession of eternal 
joys. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

&amp;gt; 

GOD, the Creator and Redeemer of all the faith- 
ful, grant unto the souls of Thy servants de 
parted the remission of all their sins, that by pious sup 
plications they may obtain the pardon which they have 
always desired. Grant this, O God, Who livest and 
reignest for ever and ever. Amen. 

EPISTLE. 
(i. Thess. iv. 12-16.) 

BRETHREN: And we will not have you ignorant 
concerning them that are asleep, that you be 
not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope. 

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even 
so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring 
with Him. 

For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that 
we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the 
Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept. 

For the Lord Himself shall come down from heaven 
with commandment and with the voice of an archangel, 
and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in 
Christ shall rise first. 

Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken 
up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into 
the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord. 

GRADUAL. 

RNAL rest grant to them, and may perpetual 
light shine upon them. V. (Ps. cxi. 7.) The 

just shall be in everlasting remembrance; he shall not 

fear the evil hearing.

by the assistance of Thy mercy, may they escape the 
sentence of Thy justice. V. And enjoy the bliss e* 
eternal light. 

THE SEQUENCE. 

(Dies Ira. See page 986.) 

THE GOSPEL. 

*T that time Jesus said to the multitude of the 
Jews: Amen, amen, I say unto you that the 
hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the 
voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. 
For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given 
to the Son also to have life in Himself; and He hath 
given Him power to do judgment, because He is the 
Son of man. Wonder not at this, for the hour cometh 
wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of 
the Son of God; and they that have done good shall 
come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that 
have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment. 

THE OFFERTORY. 

OLORD Jesus Christ, King of glory! deliver the 
souls of all the faithful departed from the pain 
ful prison of purgatory. We offer Thee, eternal Father, 
a sacrifice of praise and of prayer: accept it on behalf of 
the souls we commemorate this day, and let them pass 
from death to life. 

Here make an offering also of your own death and suffer 
ings in union with the holy sacrifice, thus: 

O my God, I offer Thee also the hour of my death 
and all the pains I am destined to suffer from this moment 



346 A Mode of Hearing Mass 

until my last breath, for Thy glory, and in union with 
the bitter pains of Jesus Passion and death. 

/T\AY the most just, most high, and most adorable 
-- will of God be done in all things, be praised and 
magnified for ever. 

Indulgence of 100 days, once a day. Pius VII., May 19, 1818. 

/^VMNIPOTENT Lord! Who dost permit evil that 
^-^ good may spring from it, listen to the humble 
prayers, by which we ask of Thee the grace of remain 
ing faithful to Thee, even unto death. Grant us also, 
through the intercession of Mary ever blessed, that we 
may always conform ourselves to Thy most holy will. 

SECRET. 

AVE mercy, we beseech Thee, O Lord, on the 
souls of Thy servants (name them), for whom 
we offer this Victim of praise, humbly beseeching Thy 
majesty that by this sacrifice they may arrive at rest 
eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

PREFACE. 

is truly just and salutary, to return Thee thanks 
at all times, and in all places, O almighty Father, 
eternal God. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, and 
through His merits, we hope for a glorious resurrection; 
so that if the sentence of death alarm and deject, the 
promise of immortality consoles and animates us; for 
to Thy faithful servants death is only a passage from 
this life to a better one. Therefore we unite with all 
the blessed citizens of the heavenly country in singing 
a hymn to Thy glory, and saying without ceasing : Holy, 
holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth: heaven and earth 
are full of Thy glory. Blessed is He that cometh in the 
name of the Lord; His blood pleads for pardon, and 
His voice rises ever to the throne of mercy in behalf 
of the faithful. Amen. 



For the Faithful Departed. 347 



THE CANON. 

E therefore suppliantly beseech Thee, O Father 
of mercies, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Our 
Lord, graciously to accept and bless this holy sacrifice 
which we offer Thee for the peace and prosperity of 
the holy Catholic Church, for Thy servant, our father, 
Pope N., for our bishop and clergy, and for all Thy 
faithful Catholic people: for the living, that they may 
prepare for death; and for the dead, that they may 
obtain eternal rest. 

recommend to Thee, O Lord, the souls of Thy 
servants N.N., and as, in mercy to them, Thou 
didst become man, so now vouchsafe to admit them into 
the number of the blessed. Remember, O Lord, that 
the souls for whom we pray are Thy creatures, not made 
by strange gods, but by Thee, the only true and living 
God, for there is no other God but Thee; none that can 
work wonders like unto Thine. 

Let their souls find comfort and mercy in Thy sight, 
and remember not their former sins, nor any of those 
faults they may have fallen into through human frailty, 
or the violence of temptation; for though they sinned, 
they still retained a true faith in Thee, O Holy Trinity, 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and a lively zeal for Thy 
honor; they faithfully adored Thee and died in favor 
with Thee, O divine Lord, as well as in peace and 
charity with all mankind. 

Remember not, O Lord, we beseech Thee, the sins 
and ignorance of their youth, but according to Thy 
great mercy, be mindful of them in Thy glory. May 
the heavens be now opened to receive them. May the 
archangel St. Michael, chief of the heavenly host, con 
duct them. May the holy angels of God meet and 
accompany them into the city of the heavenly Jerusalem. 
May blessed Peter, the apostle to whom were given the 



348 A Mode of Hearing Mass 

keys of heaven, receive them. May holy Paul, the 
apostle who was a vessel of election, help them. May 
St. John, the beloved disciple to whom God revealed 
the secrets of heaven, intercede for them. May all the 
holy apostles, to whom was given the power of binding 
and loosing, pray for them. May all the blessed and 
chosen servants of God intercede for them, that being 
delivered from present confinement and suffering, they 
may be admitted into the kingdom of heaven, through 
the assistance and merits of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ, Who livest, etc. 

And now, all-powerful God, at this awful moment, 
when, by the words of consecration, Thy divine Son is 
actually present, I offer up to Thee thi-s same beloved 
Son, Who died for mankind. I humbly entreat Thee, 
through the infinite merits of His death, to show com 
passion and mercy to the souls for whose repose the holy 
sacrifice is this day offered. 

AT THE ELEVATION. 

AIL! most blessed Jesus,* eternal Son of the most 
high God! Oh, deign to be merciful to those for 
whom we pray ; Thou Who didst expire on the cross for 
their sake, give rest to their souls. 

AIL! sacred blood, that flowed for the sins of the 
world; wash away whatever stains may render 
Thy servants unfit to be admitted into heaven. O 
good and merciful God, look on the face of Thy Christ, 
in Whom Thou art always well pleased, and permit the 
souls for which He suffered to rest eternally in Thy 
divine presence. 

AFTER THE ELEVATION. 

"T-tORD Jesus Christ, we earnestly entreat Thee by 
-** Thy bitter agony and prayer in the garden to 



For the Faithful Departed. 349 

become an advocate with Thy eternal Father on behalf 
of Thy servants N.N. Lay before Him, we conjure 
Thee, all those drops of blood which in Thy anguish of 
spirit flowed from Thy sacred body, and offer them as 
a sacrifice of atonement, that thereby the souls of N.N. 
may be discharged from all the punishment still due to 
divine Justice for their sins. 



Jesus, Who wast pleased to suffer death on 
the cross for the redemption of mankind, we 
humbly beseech Thee to offer up all the anguish and pain 
which Thou didst endure, especially at the moment of 
Thy death, on behalf of Thy servants, that Thy precious 
merits may be accepted for the repose of their souls. 



God almighty, I beseech Thee, by the pre- 
cious body and blood of Thy divine Son Jesus, 
w r hich He gave with His own hand upon the eve of His 
Passion to His beloved apostles to be their meat and 
drink, and which He left to His whole Church to be a 
perpetual sacrifice and life-giving food of His own faith 
ful people, deliver the souls in purgatory, and espe 
cially that one which was most devoted to this mystery 
of infinite love; that, with .Thy divine Son, and with 
Thy Holy Spirit, it may ever praise Thee for this Thy 
wondrous love in Thy eternal glory. Amen. 

*T~^ORD God almighty, I beseech Thee, by the pre- 
^* cious blood which Thy divine Son shed on the 
cross from His most sacred hands and feet, deliver the 
souls in purgatory, and especially that soul for which I 
am most bound to pray; that the blame rest not with 
me that Thou bringest it not forthwith to praise Thee 
in Thy glory and to bless Thee forever. Amen. 

"ylORD God almighty, I beseech Thee, by the pre- 
**""* cious blood, which gushed forth from the side 
of Thy divine Son Jesus, in the sight and to the extreme 



350 A Mode of Hearing Mass 

pain of His most holy Mother, deliver the souls in pur 
gatory, and especially that one amongst them, which 
was ever the most devout to our blessed Lady; that it 
may soon attain unto Thy glory, there to praise Thee 
in her, and her in Thee, world without end. Amen. 

Have mercy, also, O Lord, in a particular manner 
upon all the souls in purgatory, who once belonged to 
this House, and upon all who were members of our 
Congregation. 

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord, and let per 
petual light shine upon them. Amen. 

PATER NOSTER. 

O DIVINE Jesus! at Whose name every knee doth 
bend, in heaven, on earth, and in hell! Sovereign 
Judge of the living and the dead! may Thy name be 
honored by the deliverance of the souls for whom we 
pray. May the gates of heaven be open to receive 
them, and may Thy will, which desires the salvation of 
all men, be this day perfectly done in their regard. 
Grant that, after having been fed on the bread of sor 
row, they may be fed with the living Bread of heaven 
in the possession of Thyself. We implore Thy forgive 
ness of the sins of our parents, friends, and benefactors, 
particularly of the sins to which we unhappily have been 
accessory. Preserve us from those avenging flames, 
which we have but too well merited by our repeated 
abuse of grace, our tepidity in Thy service, and our neg 
ligence in resisting temptation. Deliver us from sin, the 
greatest of all evils, and enable us to feel and under 
stand that it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands 
of the living God. Amen. 

AT THE AGNUS DEI. 

AMB of God, Who takest away the sins of the 
world, grant them rest. Lamb of God,

them everlasting rest. 

AT THE COMMUNION. 

I MOST ardently desire, O my adorable Saviour, 
that Thou wouldst honor this day the dwelling of 
my heart by Thy divine presence. With what confi 
dence could I then implore rest and eternal peace for 
the suffering souls of purgatory whom Thou lovest, 
though Thy justice forces Thee to banish them for a 
time from their heavenly inheritance. Look, neverthe 
less, O merciful Redeemer, on the work of Thy hands; 
hasten the happy hour of their deliverance. Grant me 
the graces of a spiritual communion, that I may sub 
missively accept and patiently bear all that is disagree 
able and painful to inclination, and thus avert a long 
separation from Thee after the close of my mortal life. 
Amen. 

POST-COMMUNION. 

RANT, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that our 
humble prayers on behalf of the souls of Thy 
servants, both men and women, may be profitable to 
them ; so that Thou mayest deliver them from all punish 
ment due to their sins, and make them partakers of 
the redemption Thou hast purchased for them. Who 
livest, etc. 

AT THE LAST "GOSPEL. 

Y now the bright company of angels meet your 
souls, O departed servants of the Lord; may 
the holy apostles receive you; may the triumphant 
army of glorious martyrs, confessors, and virgins wel 
come you; and may peace and joy be your portion for 
ever in the company of all the saints. May you behold

the happiness of the elect. 

A PRAYER AFTER MASS. 

ND now, O God, having recommended to Thy 
mercy the souls of Thy departed servants, grant 
we may ever remember that we are most certainly to 
follow them. Give us grace to prepare for our last hour 
by a good life, that so death, however sudden it may be, 
may not find us unworthy of admittance into eternal 
glory. Open likewise the eyes, and soften the hearts* 
of all sinners; inspire them, we humbly beseech Thee, 
with a true sense of their dreadful danger, that by a 
timely consideration of the uncertainty of life, and the 
certainty of death, they may be sincerely converted, 
and, obtaining pardon for their sins in this life, be happy 
with Thee forever in the next. Amen.

A PRAYER BEFORE MASS. 



OMY God, I humbly- prostrate myself before Thee, 
to assist at the holy sacrifice of the Mass, and to 
adore my sovereign Lord in the great mystery of the 
Passion and death of Thy holy Son. I praise and 
glorify Thee in union with the holy and immaculate 
Virgin Mary, whom Thou hast sanctified and preserved 
from all stain of original sin, and hast ordained to be 
the Mother of Thy only-begotten Son, my Lord and 



of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 353 

Redeemer. Grant that I and all these faithful here 
present may assist at the celebration of this mystery of 
love with humility and purity of heart, with that rever 
ence, fervor, and devotion with which Mary, the blessed 
Mother of Jesus Christ, prayed to Thee during the 
many years she remained in the Temple; but particu 
larly when she received the message of the angel, who, 
in Thy name, saluted her "full of grace, and blessed 
amongst women." 

O holy Mary, Mother of God, and Queen of heaven 
and earth! to thee we, poor banished children of Eve, 
have recourse. I intend to assist at this holy sacrifice 
in thanksgiving to God the Father, for having . predes 
tined thee His chosen daughter; to the eternal Son 
for having made thee His beloved Mother; to the Holy 
Ghost for having sanctified thee His cherished spouse. 
Pray for me and for all thy servants. Obtain that I 
may participate in the fruits of the Passion and death 
ot thy beloved Son, Our Lord, and Redeemer, on Whose 
mysteries I am going to meditate during this holy sacri 
fice of the Mass. Amen. 

O Mary, refuge of sinners, conceived without sin, 
pray for us who have recourse to thee! 

AT THE BEGINNING OF MASS. 

O INFINITE Creator and merciful God! Thou 
hast been pleased, by the incarnation of Thy 
only-begotten Son, to repair the losses caused by the 
disobedience of our first parents; Thou didst send the 
angel Gabriel to that chosen maid who, by becoming 
the Mother of the Redeemer, crushed the infernal ser 
pent s head, and brought salvation to all mankind. Do 
Thou, O Lord, Who displayed Thy infinite power in 
forgiving and showing mercy to poor sinners, give ear 
to our humble prayers, and grant that we, who firmly 
believe that Thy eternal Son became man in the chaste 



354 Mode of Hearing Mass in Honor 

womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and that she is, there 
fore, truly the Mother of God, may be helped by her 
prayers. I adore Thee, O my God, in this profound 
mystery, the fruits whereof were first felt by the pre 
cursor, who, at the words of Mary s salutation to St. 
Elizabeth, was sanctified in his mother s womb. Let 
us give praise to God, for He is good, and His mercy 
endureth for ever. My sou. 1 doth magnify the Lord ; my 
spirit rejoiceth in God my Saviour. But I am unworthy, 
O Lord, of Thy favors. How can I dare to appear 
before Thee, O my God? 

I confess to almighty God, to the blessed and immacu 
late Mary, ever virgin, to St. Michael the archangel, 
to John the Baptist, to the holy apostles Peter and 
Paul, and to all the saints, that I have sinned in thought, 
word, and deed, through my fault, through my fault, 
through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech 
the blessed and immaculate Mary, ever virgin, blessed 
Michael the archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the 
holy apostles Peter and Paul, and all the saints, to pray 
to the Lord our God for me. 

May the almighty God have mercy on me, forgive 
me my sins, and bring me to everlasting life. Amen. 

May the almighty and merciful Lord grant me par 
don, absolution, and remission of all my sins. Amen. 

To thee, O merciful Queen of heaven and earth, I 
have recourse. It has never been heard of that any 
one invoked thee and was forsaken. Plead for me 
before thy divine Son and obtain for me the pardon of 
my sins. 

AT THE INTROIT. 

AIL, holy Mother, who didst bring forth the King 
who reigns over heaven and earth forever! 
Hail, Mary, full of grace! the Lord is with thee; 
blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the 



of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 355 

fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, 
pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. 
Amen. 

AT THE KYRIE ELEISON. 

LORD, have mercy on me! O Jesus, have mercy 
on me! O Lord Jesus, have mercy on me, a 
sinner! 

O Mary, refuge of sinners, pray for me! 

AT THE GLORIA IN EXCELSIS. 

RY be to God on high, and peace on earth to 
men of good- will. O my God, I unite my 
praises with those which the heavenly spirits sang to 
Thee on that night, when Thy beloved Son, made man, 
was born of the Virgin Mary in the stable of Bethlehem. 
My heart is full of gladness, because for my salvation 
the Word of God was made man, and dwelt among men. 
Glory, praise, and adoration be to God the Father, to 
God the Son, and to God the Holy Ghost; three Per 
sons in one God. O holy Virgin Mary, thou art the 
glorious Mother of my Redeemer. Remember the joy 
thy immaculate and maternal heart did feel when for 
the first time thou didst behold, adore, and embrace 
thy God and thy infant Son in the stable of Bethlehem. 
O blessed Mother of God, pray to thy Son, that I may 
be made partaker of the joy of heaven. Amen.

holy word fructify in the soil of our hearts; may our 
souls be guided by Thy holy law and directed to the 
possession of Thee. O God, have mercy on us, and 
bring us to Thee, as by the appearance of a miraculous 
star Thou didst bring the Wise Men to the stable of 
Bethlehem, where they found and adored the Saviour 
in the arms of the Blessed Virgin Mary, His holy Mother, 
and offered Him, with their hearts, their mysterious 
presents. O blessed Mary, obtain for us the grace to

AT THE GOSPEL. 

|Y dear Redeemer, I give Thee thanks for the 
inestimable favor Thou hast bestowed upon me, 
by calling me to the knowledge of Thy holy Gospel, 
and making me a child of the one holy Catholic and 
Apostolic Church. I believe and confess all and each 
of the articles of faith which Thou hast revealed to Thy 
Church, and which the same Church proposes and 
teaches. I am ready, if it be Thy will, to shed the last 
drop of my blood for my faith. I return Thee thanks 
for that love which prompted Thee to leave to Thy 
Church in the Holy Sacrament of the Altar Thy body 
and blood, Thy soul and divinity. I believe, O Lord, 
that Thou art really present in the Holy Eucharist. When 
with the eyes of faith I see my Lord upon the altar, I 
can say: "Now, O Lord, let Thy servant depart in 
peace, for my eyes have seen Thy salvation." O sweet 
Mary, thou didst bring thy holy Son to the Temple, and 
didst offer Him to the eternal Father. The holy man 
Simeon received Jesus, in his arms from thy hands. Oh, 
bring my Saviour into my poor heart, that I may love 
nothing else but Hftn and thee. Amen. 

AT THE OFFERTORY. 

OHOLY Father, almighty and eternal God, accept 
from the hands of Thy minister the unspotted

honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of all the saints. 
In the spirit of humility and contrition of heart I now 
offer to Thee, O Lord, this bread and wine, which, 
through the words of benediction, which Christ our 
Lord instituted at the Last Supper, will be changed into 
the body and blood of Thy divine Son, our Saviour. 
Come, O almighty and eternal God, the Sanctifier, and 
bless this sacrifice prepared for the praise and glory 
of Thy holy name. Receive, O Lord, this sacrifice to 
the praise and glory of Thy infinite Majesty, to our 
benefit, and to that of the whole Church, and also to the 
honor of the blessed Mother of Jesus Christ, that she 
may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven whose mem 
ory we celebrate on earth. Through Christ our Lord. 
Amen. 

O merciful God, direct and assist me in the dangers 
of this life, as Thou didst direct Mary, the blessed 
Mother of Jesus, and her pure spouse, St. Joseph, in 
their flight into Egypt. O Lord, save Thy servants,

AT THE PREFACE. 

IT is truly meet, and just, and right, and available to 
salvation, that we should always, and in all places, 
give thanks to Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty, 
eternal God, a nd bless and glorify Thee, on the venera 
tion * of the blessed Mary, ever virgin, who, by the over 
shadowing of the Holy Ghost, conceived Thy only- 
begotten Son, and, her virginity still remaining, brought 
forth the eternal Light of the world, Jesus Christ our 
Lord. By whom the angels praise Thy Majesty, the 
dominations adore it, the powers tremble before it, the 
heavens, the heavenly virtues and blessed seraphim 
with common jubilee, glorify it. Together with whom 
we beseech Thee that we may be admitted to join our 
humble voices, saying: 

Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth; the heavens 
and the earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the 
highest. Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the 
Lord. Hosanna in the highest. 

AT THE CANON. 

f\ ALMIGHTY God, Thy beloved Son and my 
^^ Lord Jesus Christ has commanded me, by His 
word and example, to be always occupied with the 
things that are Thine. It was in the Temple that His 
blessed Mother and St. Joseph found Him on the third 
day after His departure from them. Grant that I may 

* Name the particular festival. 



360 Mode of Hearing Mass in Honor 

never depart from Thee by sin. But if I ever have 
the misfortune of forfeiting Thy holy grace, 1 will sue 
again for mercy in the Sacrament of Penance. Pray 
for me, O glorious Mother of God, and be my advocate 
before thy Son. At thy suggestion He changed, in Cana 
of Galilee, water into wine; beg of Him to change my 
heart too, to purify and sanctify it, that it may be worthy 
of Him for ever. 

my God, when Mary pronounced these words: 
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it done unto me 
according to thy word," Thy only-begotten Son became 
incarnate in her womb. In like manner at the words 
of consecration, which are about to be pronounced by 
Thy minister, the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, descends 
on our altars, and miraculously changes the substance 
of bread and wine into His body and blood, soul and 
divinity. I humbly adore Thee, O loving Saviour, in 
this mystery of Thy love. Through that divine charity 
which moved Thee to utter those consoling words a 
few moments before the institution of this Sacrament: 
"With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with 
you before I suffer," I beg of Thee to have mercy on 
me, and to forgive me my sins. Help me in my necessi 
ties, strengthen me against the enemies of my soul, and 
grant me the grace I stand in need of to secure my 
eternal salvation. 

1 pray to Thee also, O Lord, for Thy holy Church, 
for our holy father the Pope, for our bishops, and all 
pastors of souls; for our Superior and for all the mem 
bers of our Order, for my parents, relatives, benefac 
tors, friends, and enemies. Grant Thy particular 
blessings to the pious clients of Thy blessed Mother. 
Bless the poor, the sick, and those who are in their 
agony. Have mercy on those who have recommended 
themselves to my prayers, who pray for me, and finally 
on all those for whom I am in justice or charity bound 
to pray. Grant peace and concord to all Christian 



of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 361 

princes and people. Convert poor sinners, enlighten 
infidels, and bring back heretics from the ways of error. 
May all Ue united in one fold, under one Shepherd. 
Jesus Christ, the true Pastor of our souls. 

Holy Mary, thy divine Son now comes upon the 
altar. Present to Him my lowly adoration. O my 
Jesus, come; come, my Saviour. Receive the prayers 
I offer Thee through the hands of Thy blessed Mother. 
Come, O Lord Jesus. With the angels, who are prostrate 
before the altar, I exclaim: Holy, holy, holy, Hosanna 
to Him that cometh from the highest heavens ever 
blessed be His name! 

AT THE ELEVATION OF THE HOST. 

JESUS Christ, Thou art the true Son of God. I 
adore Thee in this holy Sacrament. Be Thou 
propitious to me and forgive me my sins. 

AT THE ELEVATION OF THE CHALICE. 

O ADORABLE blood, which Jesus, the true Son 
of God and true Son of Mary, has shed for me 
on the cross! I adore Thee, O my Redeemer, and I 
hide myself in Thy sacred wounds, from which the 
price of my redemption flowed. O Jesus, grant that I 
may live for Thee and die for Thee. Help, O Lord, 
Thy servants whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy 
precious blood. 



O 



AFTER THE ELEVATION. 

An Act of Adoration. 

MERCIFUL Father, look down from Thy 
heavenly throne on the holy and immaculate 
Victim now reposing on this altar. Thou hast given 
us Thy only Son, and with Him and through Him Thou 
hast bestowed on us all the treasures of Thy grace. In 
this holy sacrifice Thou hast furnished us with the means 



362 Mode of Hearing Mass in Honor 

of offering Thee the adoration Thou deservest. Jesus 
Christ here present adores Thee for us. Accept His 
adoration, which is worthy of Thy sovereign Majesty 
Ah! how happy am I to have wherewith to discharge 
my obligation toward Thy divine Majesty. This 
oblation is infinitely more pleasing in Thy sight than 
those of Thy servant Abel, of Abraham, the father of 
the faithful, or of Melchisedech, the high priest, who 
offered bread and wine as the figure of the sacrifice of 
Thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 

AN ACT OF THANKSGIVING. 

*7jrCCEPT, O most merciful God, the sacrifice of 
eJ 1 -^ Thy Son in thanksgiving for all the benefits 
Thou hast granted me. Thou hast created me to Thine 
own image and likeness. Thou hast redeemed me 
with Thy Son s precious blood. Thou hast called 
me to the true faith, and preserved me from eternal 
death, which I so often deserved for my sins. Thou 
hast called me as one of Thy favored children to follow 
Thee more closely in the way of the evangelical counsels. 
What return shall I make Thee for these and all Thy 
favors? I offer Thee Thy only Son, Who, before He 
instituted this Most Holy Sacrament, lifted up His eyes, 
and gave thanks to Thee, His Father almighty. I 
offer Him now immolated on this altar; and thus I 
make an adequate thanksgiving for all the blessings 
Thou hast bestowed on me and on all mankind. 

AN ACT OF ATONEMENT. 

*7ESUS, my Saviour! By Thy Passion and death 
eJ Thou hast purchased for me the rewards of 
eternal life, and Thou still continuest to offer Thyself 
a holocaust of propitiation in the holy sacrifice or the 
Mass. Therefore, I offer Thee to Thy eternal Father 



of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 363 

as an atonement for my innumerable sins. O heavenly 
Father, by the sacrifice of Thy Son Thou hast cancelled 
the handwriting of the decree which stood against me, 
and hast fastened it to the cross. No longer does the 
blood of calves or other victims propitiate Thee to peni 
tent sinners; Jesus is our atonement. His precious 
blood, like that of Abel, cries out to Thee for mercy. 
Look on Thy divine Son; forgive me my sins, which I 
detest from the bottom of my heart. Have mercy on 
me a sinner; forgive me through the merits of Jesus 
Christ. 

AN ACT OF SUPPLICATION. 

MY God, I am unworthy to appear before Thee. 
I acknowledge my misery and poverty. Thou 
art the fountain of all grace, and the source of all good. 
Thy beloved Son has commanded me to pray to Thee, 
and to call Thee by the consoling name of Father. There 
fore I prostrate myself with confidence before Thee, and 
present to Thee my humble supplication through the 
same Lord Jesus Christ, Who makes intercession for 
me. Grant me a lively faith, a firm and constant hope, 
and an ardent charity toward Thee and my neighbor. 
Save my soul. Give ma strength to vanquish my 
spiritual enemies. Grant me a humble resignation to 
Thy holy will in the adversities of this life; and, above 
all, the gifts of final perseverance in Thy love and ser 
vice. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. 

Have mercy also, O Lord, on the souls of the faithful 
departed on those of my parents, benefactors, rela 
tives, friends, and on all those for whom I am bound to 
pray. Remember, O Lord, those who while living were 
most devoted to Thy blessed Mother; grant them all 
rest from their torments, and bring them to heaven. 
I apply to the souls in purgatory the holy indulgences 
granted to the faithful who assist at the holy sacrifice of 
the Mass, and I intend to enter into the dispositions 



364 Mode of Hearing Mass in Honor 

necessary to gain them, through Thy grace and 
mercy. 

Our Father, Who art in heaven, etc. 

O my Redeemer! Thou hast commanded me by 
word and example to forgive my enemies. I forgive 
them from the bottom of my heart for the love of Thee. 
Grant them, O Lord, all the graces and blessings that 
are necessary for their spiritual and temporal welfare. 
Now, my Saviour, as I have done what Thou hast com 
manded, do Thou fulfil what Thou hast promised, and 
forgive me my sins. 

Thou didst not forget me, O sweet Jesus, even in Thy 
agony. Before expiring on the cross Thou didst leave me 
Thy sorrowful and afflicted Mother to be my Mother 
also. "Behold thy Son behold thy Mother." I re 
turn Thee thanks, O my Saviour, for this inestimable 
favor. And thou, my tender Mother, thou hast begotten 
me at the foot of the cross. I am the child of thy sorrow. 
Take me under thy protection. Conduct me to Jesus. 
Teach me to love Him. O Mother, O tender Mother! 
how happy am I in the glorious privilege of being thy 
child. O Mary, show that thou art my Mother. 

AGNUS DEI.

world, have mercy on me. (Three times.) 

SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

JESUS! Thou hast given us in the Holy Eucharist 
Thy body and blood to be our spiritual nourish 
ment, through which we may have life everlasting. 
Would that I were worthy to receive Thee this day in 
the holy communion! I desire, with all my heart, to 
receive the living Bread which came down from 
heaven. 



of the Blessed Virgin Jlfary. 365 

O Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter 
under my roof; say but the word, and my soul shall be 
healed. (Three times.) Let me taste, at least, the 
sweetness of a spiritual communion. Come to me, 
Jesus, my Lord, my Master. Come and refresh my 
soul. Strengthen me, that in union with Thee I may 
do perfectly the heavenly Father s will. Let me never 
be separated from Thee by sin. 

Soul of Jesus, sanctify me. Body of Jesus, save me. 
Blood of Jesus, wash me. Water out of the side of 
Jesus, purify me. Passion of Jesus, comfort me. O 
good Jesus, hear me. Hide me within Thy sacred 
wounds. O Sacred Heart of Jesus, receive me. O 
immaculate heart of Mary, plead for me, and love me. 

O sweet Mother, obtain for me the grace of receiving 
the holy communion with worthy dispositions, especially 
in my last sickness, when I shall be called to appear 
before the tribunal of God, that, through the merits of 
my Saviour s death and Passion, and thy intercession, 
I may have life everlasting. Amen. 

AFTER COMMUNION. 

/T\Y loving Saviour, after having suffered for three 
^"^ hours the most cruel agony ; after having accom 
plished all that had been foretold of Thee, Thou dids 
expire on the cross. All nature trembled at Thy death 
The rocks were split asunder and yet, alas, my un 
grateful heart is insensible. I have, by my sins, been 
Thy heartless executioner. O my Redeemer, how 
can I dare to stand before Thee? But Thou did?t 
pardon the penitent thief; and this inspires me with 
the hope that Thou wilt pardon me also, and admit me, 
like him, to the enjoyment of Thy happy kingdom. 

O Mary, Queen of martyrs, through the sorrow which 
overwhelmed thy heart at the foot of the cross, while 
thou wert witnessing the last painful act of Our Saviour s 



366 Afode of Hearing Mass in Honor 

Passion through the anguish thou didst feel when 
thou didst accompany His sacred body to the tomb, and 
the desolation thou didst experience on thy return, I 
beseech thee to obtain that His Passion and thy sorrows 
may be ever engraven on my heart, that I may never 
cease to deplore my sins, which were the cause of His 
death and of thy anguish. 

AT THE POST- COMMUNION. 

"Tf^AVING received, O Lord, what is calculated to

AT THE LAST GOSPEL. 

MY God, I believe in Thee, I hope in Thee, and 
I love Thee with all my heart. May Thy holy 
Gospel be propagated throughout the world. Assist 
the ministers whom Thou hast appointed to carry the 
light of faith to unbelievers, or to revive it among luke 
warm Christians. Grant to all the clergy that spirit of 
zeal, fortitude, and knowledge which Thou didst impart 
to Thy holy apostles on the day of Pentecost. Thou 
hast commanded us, O Lord, to pray to the Lord of 
the harvest that He may send laborers to work in His 
vineyard. Wherefore I humbly beseech Thee, Who 
didst open the prophets mouths, and didst call the 
apostles to announce Thy word, to send us worthy pas 
tors, and to grant that they may edify the flock, destroy 
errors and abuses, root out vice, dispel ignorance, and 
establish Thy reign in the souls Thou hast redeemed 
with Thy blood. Bless all Religious, that they may 
be faithful to their holy calling, and advance with all 
zeal possible Thy kingdom on earth. Reign Thou, O 
Christ, over all Religious, and over all men by Thy 
love, and inspire them all with a love of Thy kingdom 
and fidelity in Thy services. O Word of God made 
flesh, grant us the grace that we may be admitted to 
the kingdom of Thy glory. Amen.

and my Mother also. O loving Mother, protect thy 
children, and conduct them to heaven. O holy Mary,

make supplication for devout women, and in particular 
for Religious. May all experience thy assistance, re 
joice in thy glory, and praise God with thee for evermore.

BEFORE CONFESSION. 

/T\Y Lord and my God! Prostrate before Thee, full 
of shame and confusion, I acknowledge I have 
broken my solemn promise to Thee, my loving Father- 
that promise on account of which Thou hast so often 
forgiven me in the past. 

O good Jesus, Saviour of the world, who gavest Thy 
self to the death of the cross to save sinners, look upon 
me, a miserable sinner, who implores Thy mercy. Spare 
me, Thou Who art my Saviour, and pity my sinful soul; 
loose its chains, heal its sores. Lord Jesus, I earnestly 
desire to return to Thee, and I am sorry with my whole 
heart that I have ever offended Thee. 

Help me now, my dear heavenly Father, for I am 
weak, and wounded, and wretched; but I come full of 
confidence to Thee, for Thou art my strength; out of 
Thee there is no rest, without Thee there is no hope, 
therefore I put my whole trust in Thee. 

O my God, make known to me the wounds which sin 
has made in my soul. Come to my aid, O Lord; with 
out Thee I can not discover them. O eternal light, dis 
pel my darkness. Heart of Jesus, enlighten me; show 
me my faults, make known to me my sins. Grant that 
I may see them all as Thou Thyself dost behold them, 
and give me courage and strength to lay them bare 
without reserve and with a truly contrite heart. 

O most gracious Virgin Mary, beloved Mother of 
Jesus Christ, my Redeemer, intercede for me, that I 
may make a good confession. Obtain for me true 
sorrow for my sins, that they may be all washed away 
in the precious blood of thy dear Son Jesus, and a firm 
purpose not to offend Him in the future.

of t&amp;gt;olE Scripture to Bictte Sorrow for Sins, 
ano Confidence. 

These may be read over, or meditated upon, in order to 
excite confusion and sorrow for sin, and confidence in God s 
infinite mercy. 

EAR, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the 
Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, 
and exalted them; but they have despised Me (Isa. i. 2). 

Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates 
th reof, be very desolate, saith the Lord For My 
people have done two evils. They have forsaken Me, 
the fountain of living water, and have digged to them 
selves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water 
(Jer. ii. 12, 13). 

Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing 
for thee, to have left the Lord thy God. . . . Thou hast 
broken My yoke, thou hast burst My bonds, and thou 
saidst: I will not serve (Jer. ii. 19, 20). 

What are these wounds in the midst of Thy hands ? . . . 
With these I was wounded in the house of them that 
loved Me (Zach. xiii. 6). 

Crucifying again to themselves the Son of God, and 
making Him a mockery (Heb. vi. 6). 

I will arise, and will go to my Father, and say to Him : 
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before Thee 
(Luke xv. 18). 

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great 
mercy (Ps. 1. 3). 

A contrite and humbled heart, O God, Thou wilt not 
despise (Ps. 1. 19). 

If your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as 
white as snow (Isa. i. 18). 

As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death 
of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and 
live (Ezech. xxxiii. ii).

sight of hell, whose endless pains one mortal 
sin deserves; the sight of heaven, whose dreadful 
loss one unrepented mortal sin entails; the sight of 
Gethsemane, where we see 

"Beneath the olives moon-pierced shade 

Our God alone, outstretched and bruised 
And bleeding on the earth He made;" 

the sight of the pretorium of Pontius Pilate, where, at the 
column of the flagellation, we behold Our Lord on the 
pavement in a pool of His own most precious blood; 
the sight of the thorn-crowned Saviour, falling under 
the weight of the cross, along the Via Dolorosa; the 
sight of Calvary, where we behold the good and gentle 
Jesus nailed upon a cross, and, in bitter agony and deso 
lation, dying a malefactor s death all impress upon us 
the heinousness and hatefulness of sin as well as the 
patience and goodness of God, and thus lead us to true 
and tender sorrow for our own sins. One mortal sin 
banishes God s grace from the soul. Unhappy is the 
soul which loses its God by sin. God, Who is all love, 
all holiness, detests sin with infinite loathing and hatred. 
We trample on the precious blood of Jesus Christ, we 
crucify Him anew when we commit sin. Detest at 
this moment all your sins, and resolve rather to suffer 
anything than ever again to offend God, Who is infi 
nitely good and holy and worthy of all your love. Take 
your crucifix in your hand, and consider attentively 
what a death that was which our dear Lord suffered 
on Calvary. Has ever malefactor suffered more than He ? 
Think of the scourging that went before; think of the

Devotions for Confession. 381 

crown of thorns; look at Him now, nailed to the cross 
the living flesh nailed hands and feet nailed by the 
huge spikes driven through them into the wood. The 
gentlest handling of those wounds would be agony, 
and He has to hang upon them with the whole weight 
of His body for three hours until death. 

Look at Him see the tortured head; the dull, glazed 
eyes; the parched lips; the quivering limbs; the ever- 
widening wounds. Think of the intense thirst; the 
dislocated bones; the agony of ever} nerve and muscle. 
Could I look unmoved upon the worst of malefactors 
in such a pitiable plight? 

And is He a malefactor? No. 

Why, then, is He here? For me in my place to 
suffer the pains due to my sins. He is here, hanging 
on the cross, to teach me what sin is what sin deserves 
to what my sins have brought Him. If ever I have 
committed one mortal sin, I have had a distinct share 
in bringing about this death of pain and shame. See 
how uncomplainingly He suffers in every member of 
His body, in every faculty of His soul. See how the 
divinity withdraws its support from the humanity except 
to enable it to suffer more. See how willingly He 
endures all this for me, to atone for my sins, to satisfy 
the Father for me, to win me the absolutions of my life. 

O Jesus, I fall on my face before Your cross to ask 
for an "intimate knowledge of the hatefulness of sin," 
to ask for grief, tears, and a sense of pain in union with 
You in torment, debased thus in order to die for my sins. 

Can I doubt that the fruit of Your Passion will be 
the full remission of all my sins, that if they be as scarlet 
they will be made as white as snow? He, that spared 
not even His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, 
how will He not also with Him give us all things give 
me His forgiveness and His peace? 

God is infinitely good; He is holiness itself. We 
can not understand what sin is because we can not un- 



382 Devotions for Confession. 

derstand what God is. And yet the attribute of God 
which sin outrages most directly is the one that im 
presses us more than any other His holiness. We fear 
it more than we fear His wisdom, His power, or even 
His justice. 

It was the holiness of God from which Adam and 
Eve sought to hide themselves, amidst the trees of 
paradise," after their sin. 

If, when Our Lord came amongst us, the little children 
swarmed around Him, and publicans and sinners pressed 
upon Him, so that their company was made a reproach 
against Him, it was because He veiled His holiness 
When for an instant He let its presence be felt, all men 
quailed before it. Peter felt it after the miraculous 
draught of fishes. It was the holiness rather than the 
power of Our Lord that impressed him, and made him 
fall at Jesus knees and cry out: "Depart from me, for 
I am a sinful man, O Lord." (Luke v. 8.) The centurion 
felt it when he said, "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou 
shouldst enter under my roof, but only say the word 
and my servant shall be healed." (Matt. viii. 8.) The 
soldiers and the priests felt it in the Garden, when they 
went back and fell to the ground. At the Last Day it 
will be the holiness of God that will terrify the wicked 
and make them cry to the mountains and rocks to fall 
upon them and hide them "from the wrath of the Lamb." 
The angels are not pure in His sight. Before His 
throne the eternal song is "Holy, Holy, Holy," as they 
cover their faces with their wings. 

O holiness of God, I fall on my face before you, to 
ask for contrition for my sins. "Have mercy on me, 
O God, according to Thy great mercy." (Ps. 1. 3.) 
"O God, be merciful to me a sinner." (Luke xviii. 13.) 
O God, what must You be in Yourself! What must be 
the overflowing goodness of that nature which can 
spend itself on one like me! Shall I not love it for its 
own sake? 



Devotions for Confession. 383 

O God, all good, the only good, surely the proof of 
Your infinite goodness is found in this that You are 
good to me. You must be infinitely good to be good 
to me. O goodness of God, which I have outraged, 
O patience of God, which I have tried so sorely, I grieve 
most sincerely that I have ever offended you, I grieve 
for the sins of the past week, for the sins of my past life, 
especially for . . . And I purpose, with the help of 
Your grace, to labor with new courage at the work of

ACT OF CONTRITION AND PRAYER FOR PARDON. 

MY God, Thou hast been so good to me, but I 
have been so careless and lukewarm in my devo 
tion to Thee. I have entangled myself too much in 
vain and transitory things; I have been too self-indul 
gent and too eager for earthly pleasures. Sweet Spouse 
of my soul, divine Master, here in Thy presence, I am 
overwhelmed with shame and confusion at the sight 
of my many sins, offences, and imperfections. But 
Thou, O God, wilt not despise a contrite and humble 
heart. I confess to Thee, most tender Father, that I 
have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed, I 
am truly sorry for having sinned, because Thou art 
infinitely good, and sin displeases Thee. Thou hast 
chosen me from among so many who were more worthy 
of Thy special love and graces, to be quite near to 
Thee, and to serve Thee in this holy house of religion; 
yet I have been neglectful of my duties, and have often 
been more devoted to self than to Thy interests. Have 



384 Devotions for Confession. 

mercy on me, my God, and forgive me my sins, which 
I abhor and regret not from any selfish motive, but 
simply and solely because they have offended Thee, Who 
in Thyself art so good, so holy, so infinitely worthy of all 
my affections. I love Thee, O infinite Goodness, with all 
my heart and above all things, and I am firmly resolved, 
with the help of Thy grace, to avoid the occasions of 
sin, and nevermore to offend Thee. In the name of 
Jesus, Thy Son, in Whom Thou art well pleased; in 
view of His merits, I beseech Thee to pardon me all my 
offences, and to restore me to Thy love, as a kind and 
tender Father. Bless me, good Father, and grant me 
the grace to be faithful to Thee unto death. Amen. 

SHORT AND EFFICACIOUS ACT OF CONTRITION. 

(St. Mechtildis.) 

OS WEFT Jesus, I grieve for my sins; vouchsafe to 
supply whatever is lacking to my true sorrow, 
and to offer for me to God the Father all the grief which 
Thou hast endured because of my sins and those of 
the whole world. Amen. 

ACT OF SORROW.* 

(At the ]oot o] the cross.) 

Y dear Lord and Saviour, my sins have fastened 
Thee to this cross. I know it is just as if I had 
myself fixed the crown of thorns upon Thy brow; as if, 
with my own hands, I had driven the nails through 
Thy sacred hands and feet. O my sweet Jesus, I did 
not know what I was doing in committing these sins. 
I did not think but I see it now. I have struck and 
wounded and insulted Thee. I am sorry, heartily 
sorry for all my sins. Forgive me, dear Lord; I will

confess them now, and I firmly resolve with Thy help, 
never to commit them again. 

ANOTHER ACT OF CONTRITION. 

LORD Jesus Christ, Lover of our souls, Who, for 
the great love wherewith Thou hast loved us, 
wouldst not the death of a sinner, but rather that he 
should be converted and live; I grieve most sincerely 
that I have offended Thee, my most loving Father and 
Redeemer, to Whom all sin is infinitely displeasing; Who 
hast so loved me that Thou didst shed Thy blood for 
me, and endure a most cruel death. O my God! O 
infinite Goodness! would that I had never offended 
Thee. Pardon me, O Lord Jesus, pardon me, most 
humbly imploring Thy mercy. Have pity upon a sinner 
for whom Thy blood pleads before the face of the Father. 
O most merciful and forgiving Lord, for the love of 
Thee I forgive all who have ever offended me. I firmly 
resolve to forsake all sins, and to avoid the occasions 
of them; and to confess, in bitterness of spirit, all those 
sins which I have committed against Thy divine good 
ness, and to love Thee, O my God, for Thine own sake, 
above all things and for ever. Give me Thy love, O 
Lord, and the grace of final perseverance.

the increase of Thy glory, to obtain pardon for my sins, 
for all the indulgences which may be gained, and for 
whatever other intentions I ought to offer it, particu 
larly to advance in Thy holy grace and love. Grant 
to my soul, O Lord, all the requisite dispositions of 
humility and contrition. Sweet Saviour of perishing 
mankind, cast an eye of pity on my sinful soul, and 
regard not the evils I have done, but rather Thine own

merits and sufferings for my salvation; they infinitely 
outweigh my sins, however enormous. Confiding in 
Thy mercies, O Jesus, I offer Thee the sacrifice Thou 
didst offer of Thyself to Thy eternal Father on the 
cross, to atone for my imperfect sorrow, and to obtain for 
me grace to avoid all sin in future. 

PRAYERS AFTER CONFESSION. 

(Psalm cii.) 

BLESS the Lord, O my soul: and let all that is within 
me praise His holy name. 

Bless the Lord, O my soul: and never forget all He 
has done for thee. 

Who forgiveth all thy iniquities: Who healeth all thy 
diseases. 

Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: Who 
crowneth thee with mercy and compassion. 

The Lord is compassionate and merciful: long-suffer 
ing and plenteous in mercy. 

He hath not dealt with us according to our sins: nor 
rewarded us according to our iniquities. 

As far as the east is from the west: so far hath He 
removed our iniquities from us. 

As a father hath compassion on his children: so hath 
the Lord compassion on them that fear Him. 

For He knoweth our frame: He remembereth that 
we are dust. 

Bless the Lord, all ye His angels: you ministers of 
His that do His will. 

Bless the Lord, all His works: in every place of His 
dominion, O my soul, bless thou the Lord. 

Let us pray. 

ALMIGHTY and merciful God, Whose mercy is 
boundless and everlasting, and of Whose good 
ness the riches are infinite, I give thanks to Thee because

Thou hast so graciously pardoned all my sins, and 
restored me to Thy grace and favor. Blessed be Thy 
divine compassion, O my God, and blessed be the in 
comprehensible love of Thy beloved Son, which con 
strained Him to institute so gentle and so mighty a 
remedy for our sins. Wherefore, in union with all the 
thanksgivings which have ever ascended to Thee from 
truly penitent hearts, I sing aloud Thy glad praises, 
on behalf of all in heaven, on earth, and in purgatory, 
for ever and ever. Amen. 

My dear Jesus, how much do I not owe Thee! By 
the merits of Thy blood I trust that I have this day been 
pardoned. I thank Thee exceedingly, and I hope to 
praise Thy mercies for ever in heaven. My God, if 
hitherto I have so often lost Thee, I will lose Thee no 
more for the time to come; I am really resolved to 
change my life. Thou deservest all my love; I wish to 
love Thee in good earnest. My will is never again to 
be separated from Thee. I promise to shun the occa 
sions of sin, and to use this means (here mention it), 
for not falling again. But Thou, my Jesus, knowest 
my weakness; give me the grace to be faithful to Thee 
until death, and to have recourse to Thee in my tempta 
tions. Most holy Virgin Mary, assist me; thou art the 
Mother of perseverance; I place all my hope in thy 
powerful intercession. Amen. 

SHORT OFFERING OF SACRAMENTAL PENANCE.

which I shall perform, and the punishment which I 
wish to endure, to satisfy Thy divine justice. Amen.

PREPARATORY PRAYER. 

FATHER of mercies! Who, not content that 
Thy only-begotten Son should have been once 
offered a bleeding Victim on the cross for our salvation, 
wouldst have the same most acceptable oblation daily 
repented in an unbloody manner upon our altars, to 
apply to our souls the fruit thereof, grant that we may 
assist at this sublime sacrifice with such reverence, 
attention, and love as to partake most plentifully of the 
fruits it is intended to produce in us, through the same 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

cious Bread of heaven, the Food of angels, the 
Eucharistic Manna of the soul. How my heart longs 
and sighs for Thee, O good, humble, gentle Jesus, Who

art hidden in the Blessed Sacrament! Thou art my Lord, 
my God, and my all, and Thou wilt deign to come to me 
this day in holy communion. I adore Thee profoundly, 
with the angels who surround Thy altar-throne of 
mercy and compassion; I bless Thee; I thank Thee; I 
am sorry for having offended Thee, and I love Thee now 
with all my heart. I wish to offer this holy communion 
in reparation for all the offences that have been com 
mitted against Thee in the Sacrament of Thy love, and 
especially in atonement for my own sins and negligences. 
I have also some other particular intentions and peti 
tions which I now recommend to Thy Sacred Heart 
(mention them), and I shall approach the holy table 
to-day with the greatest confidence that Thou, O Lord, 
wilt grant me all my requests.

Indulgence of 100 days, once a day. Pius IX., Feb. 29, 1868. 

OLY Mary, Mother of God, St. John, evangelist 
and beloved disciple of Our Lord, St. Thomas 
Aquinas, St. Alphonsus Liguori, St. Paschal Baylon, 
St. Francis Xavier, St. Aloysius, St. Juliana, Blessed 
Margaret Mary Alacoque, St. Clara, St. Gertrude, St. 
Mechtildis! Ye great saints and lovers of Jesus in the 
Sacrament of His love, pray for me that I may receive 
the Lord most worthily in holy communion, that I may 
love Him more and more, and that I may follow His 
example and persevere in my holy vocation to the end 
of my life. 

AT THE BEGINNING OF MASS. 

I BELIEVE in Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, because 
Thou art Truth itself, and Thou hast said: "My

flesh is meat indeed; and My blood is drink indeed." 
I hope in Thee, O infinite Mercy, because in Thy good 
ness toward us Thou hast promised that "whosoever 
shall eat of this bread shall live forever." I love Thee, 
O eternal Goodness, above all things, with that love 
"which is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, Who 
is given to us;" and therefore I grieve with my whole 
heart for the sins I have committed, and I detest them, 
with the resolution of not sinning for the future. "A 
contrite and humble heart, O God, Thou wilt not 
despise." 

O my God, I wish to be present at the holy sacrifice 
of the Mass which is about to begin, with all possible 
attention and devotion, for I believe it is the very same 
sacrifice, offered up now in an unbloody manner, which 
was once offered up for us on Calvary. Help me, O 
my God, to be very attentive, and to unite my intention 
with that of the priest in offering it up to Thee as an 
act of adoration, thanksgiving, reparation, and prayer; 
particularly to obtain the grace of a good communion, 
and a complete transformation of myself into the like 
ness of Jesus Christ. 

CONFITEOR AND KYRIE. 

/~V MY God, give me the purity and holiness necessary 
^-^ to approach the holy table in a worthy manner. 
Lord, I am a poor sinner. I am heartily sorry for all 
the sins of my life, because by them I have offended 
Thee, Who art infinitely good and worthy of all love. 
Kyrie eleison! Have mercy on me, according to Thy 
great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy 
mercies, blot out my iniquities.

AT THE GLORIA IN EXCELSIS. 

Give glory to God, praise His goodness, and beg peace 
and happiness of soul, saying: 

ORY and thanks be to Thee, O God, for having 
worked such wonders for us, Thy creatures, born 
in sin. I praise, O Lord, Thy goodness; I bless Thy 
holy name; I adore Thy greatness and power; I beg 
of Thee to infuse into my heart that peace and joy which 
Thou didst come on earth to spread amongst men. 
Give me strength of will against my evil tendencies; 
destroy my bad habits; help me to do Thy will and 
thus to become a saint. 

AT THE COLLECTS SAY: 

GOD, Who, under a wonderful Sacrament, hast 
left us a memorial of Thy Passion, grant, we 
beseech Thee, so to venerate the sacred mysteries of 
Thy body and blood, that we may ever feel within us 
the fruit of Thy redemption. Who livest and reignest 
with the Father in the unity of the Holy Ghost, now 
and for ever. Amen. 

Give me daily more and more, O my God, Thy grace 
and Thy love, that I may ke my eyes fixed upon 
eternal things and persevere i i hy service, until v/ith 
the saints and angels I may praise and glorify Thee 
for ever in heaven. Amen. 

AT THE EPISTLE. 

E saints and prophets of the Old Law desired to 
see the things that I see, and did not see them, 
and to hear the things that I hear, and never heard them. 
How ardently Abraham and Moses, and David and 
Daniel, and Elias desired the coming of this Redeemer. 
They saw the types and figures ; I see the reality. Moses 
saw the manna and the paschal lamb; I see the Bread 



Devotions for Holy Communion. 40 

from heaven and the Lamb of God Who takes Kway 
the sins of the world. The heart of David panted for 
Thee, my God, as the hart for the water-brooks, and 
Daniel was called "a man of desires." Oh, that I 
could desire Thee as they did! What a shame it would 
be if their desires were more fervent than my thanks 
giving now for the favors and graces that I have re 
ceived through the Incarnation and Passion of Jesus, 
and especially through the Holy Eucharist. I offer 
Thee all their desires, and with David I cry out: "What 
have I in heaven but Thee? And, besides Thee, what 
do I desire upon earth? Thou art the God of my 
heart, and my portion forever." 

AT THE GOSPEL. 

Promise God that you will always listen with great rever 
ence to His word, saying: 

\Y Thy word, O my God, be always a sweet 
music to my ears, and as honey to my lips. To 
whom shall I listen but to Thee, Who hast the words 
of eternal life. The words of men are as chaff scattered 
by the wind, but Thy words endure forever. These 
are Thy words, O Lord: "Labor not for the meat that 
perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life ever 
lasting." "The bread of God is that which cometh 
down from heaven." "I am the Bread of life; he that 
cometh to Me shall not hunger, and he that believeth 
in Me shall not thirst forever." "He that eateth My 
flesh and drinketh My blood hath everlasting life, and 
I will raise him up at the Last Day." Thanks be to 
God. 

CREDO. 

An Act of Faith, Adoration, and Love. 
MY God, I firmly believe that Thou art really, 
truly, and substantially present, as God and 
man, with soul and body, with flesh and blood, in the 



406 Devotions for Holy Communion. 

Most Holy Sacrament 01 the altar. I salute and adore 
Thee, sacred Host, Bread of angels, Sanctuary of the 
divinity. My faith teaches me that Thou, O God, art 
present under the sacramental species. I believe that 
these frail appearances conceal from us Thy human 
ity, united to Thy divinity. And though, indeed, this 
sublime mystery surpasses my understanding, I revere 
it with joy and contemplate it with respect. I am ready 
also to give my life as a witness to this truth. 

My dear Lord Jesus in the Holy Eucharist, I love 
Thee. Forgive my past indifference, my coldness and 
neglect toward the Sacrament of Thy love. Grant 
that I may love Thee more and more generously. My 
kind Jesus, I wish by my presence at Mass this morn 
ing to honor the wound in Thy Sacred Heart, in order 
that through it Thou mayest pour Thy blessings, accord 
ing to Thy good pleasure, on Thy friends and mine. 
Pardon my sins; establish Thy kingdom in my heart; 
reign therein supremely. Raise a barrier against the 
spirit of the world. Teach me to transform my actions 
-into as many acts of love, so that after having known 
and loved Thee here below, by the light of faith, I may 
behold Thee face to face in all Thy glory, and love 
Thee in heaven for all eternity. 

OFFERTORY. 

Present yourself to God, begging of Him to effect an entire 
change in your heart. 

JESUS, Thou art all-powerful, and it is this power 
which, through the words of Thy priest, changes 
bread into Thy body, and wine into Thy precious blood. 
O my good God, do Thou work a like change in me, 
that no longer of this world as I have hitherto been, I 
may become truly spiritual; that I may seek after and 
relish only the things of God; that grace, virtue, and 
heaven may be in my eyes the only true and solid goods; 
that, animated with Thy sentiments, O my Jesus, I may 



Devotions for Holy Communion. 407 

be transformed into Thee, that Thou mayest dwell in 
me, and in all those who participate with me in the bless 
ings of Thy love. Almighty God, receive my heart; I 
unite it to the sacrifice Thou makest of Thyself ; I place 
it in Thy hands; transform and consecrate it. Say only 
one word, and it shall be entirely changed for the future, 
following only the sweet impulse of Thy grace, which 
shall make it love virtue. With this offering of my 
heart, O my God, I consecrate to Thee my mind, that 
it may know Thee; my body, that it may be employed 
in Thy service; my whole self, that so I may one day 
find myself absorbed in Thee. 

AT THE SECRET PRAYERS. 

|^fRACIOUSLY hear us, O God, that, by virtue 
^&amp;J of this Sacrament, Thou mayest defend us from 
all enemies both of body and soul, and give us grace in 
this life and glory in the next, through Jesus Christ 
our Lord. Amen. 

AT THE PREFACE AND THE SANCTUS. 

T us give thanks to the Lord our God! For it is 
meet and just. I give Thee thanks, my divine 
Saviour, for the institution of this most wonderful 
Sacrament, in which Thou hast bequeathed to us the 
Fountain of all graces, as a perpetual remembrance 
of Thy boundless love and bitter sufferings. I give 
Thee thanks for the numerous graces that I have re 
ceived through this Sacrament at Mass, holy commun 
ion, benediction, and in my visits before the taber 
nacle. 

I love Thee, my Lord, and because I love Thee, I 
give myself entirely to Thee. I long to receive Thee 
this day; however, while longing for Thee, dear Jesus, 
to come into my heart, and to unite Thyself to me as 
the best of all friends, I must not forget Thy might and

majesty. How great and glorious, how wise and beau 
tiful art Thou, O my God! How presumptuous it would 
be to entertain the desire to come so near to Thee, hadst 
not Thou Thyself invited me. I am a poor sinner; 
yet I love Thee, and because Thou art good, I am sorry 
for having offended Thee. And though I believe that 
Thou, the great God, art coming into my heart, I do 
not lose my awe and reverence for Thee, but can only 
wonder at Thy marvelous goodness and condescension. 
Let me, then, join my feeble voice to that of the thou 
sands of angels who surround Thy throne, singing 
before Thee in unceasing chorus: Holy, Holy, Holy, 
Lord God of hosts! The heavens and the earth are 
full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest! Blessed 
is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, Who is about 
to descend upon this altar, and come into my very heart 
to bless me and to fill me with the treasures of grace 
and the riches of His love. Hosanna in the highest! 

AT THE CANON. 

Memento for the Living. 

IN this holy sacrifice, O Lord and Saviour, Jesus 
Christ, Thou art the Mediator between the heavenly 
Father and sinful man; Thou art the High-Priest ap 
pointed for man to present his petitions to his God. 
Therefore I implore Thee to hearken to my prayer, not 
only for myself but also for all for whom I am in charity 
bound to pray. Obtain for us through this holy sacri 
fice the remission of our sins, mercy, and reconciliation 
with the heavenly Father; imbue us with strength and 
valor in the warfare against the enemies of our soul; 
give us fortitude and fidelity in the pursuit of virtues; 
aid us in the practice of all good works, and bless us 
with the grace of final perseverance. Permit me to 
offer my supplications for the peace and prosperity of 
Thy holy Church; bless and protect the Holy Father, 



Devotions for Holy Communion. 409 

Thy vicar on earth ; have mercy on the bishops, priests, 
Religious, and all who labor in Thy vineyard; animate 
them with zeal for the sanctification and salvation of 
souls. Inflame their hearts with divine charity; render 
their lives as holy as the law they inculcate; make them 
all according to Thine own divine Heart, and let their 
light so shine before men that they, seeing their good 
works, may glorify the Father Who is in heaven. Par 
don the sinners and convert all to the true faith. O ye 
holy apostles, martyrs, and virgins, whom the Church 
remembers in the Canon of the Mass, intercede for us, 
for all our friends, relatives, benefactors, and for all 
those to whom we have promised our prayers, that the 
good God may give them that grace which will most 
help them to save their souls, to lead a quiet and peace 
ful life in this world, and to be happy with Thee for ever 
in heaven. And do Thou, O divine Saviour, gra 
ciously condescend to come now upon our altar, to bless 
Thy servants who kneel before Thee in profound adora 
tion. 

AT THE CONSECRATION AND ELEVATION. 

OUR dear Lord is now coming down on the altar. When 
the priest pronounces the words of consecration, troops 
of angels descend from heaven to adore their God at that most 
solemn moment. When the bell rings and the sacred Host 
and the precious blood are elevated, first lift up your eyes to 
your God with holy faith, strong hope, and ardent love; then 
bow the head in deepest adoration, praise Him with the 
heavenly host, thank Him, make atonement by compunction 
of heart and beg Him by His precious blood, here truly pres 
ent on the altar, to purify your soul from every stain and pre 
pare it to receive Him worthily.

AFTER THE ELEVATION. 

Memento jor the Dead. 

Reflect on the happiness you are about to receive at holy 
communion. Make acts of love and longing desire, coupled 
with sorrow for sins. Pray for the faithful departed. 

OLORD Jesus Christ, on Whose glory the angels 
and saints in heaven gaze with rapturous delight, 
Thou hast deigned out of love for us to come down 
from Thy bright and happy heaven, to veil Thy beauty 
under the appearances of bread and wine, to dwell 
upon our poor altar, and art even now ready to come 
into our hearts. Would that my soul were adorned 
with all those flowers of virtue, which my good Jesus 
desires to find at His coming. In my poverty, I must 
appeal to Thyself, my Lord, and I therefore beg of 
Thee, when Thou comest into my heart, to plant there 
the seed of every flower that is pleasing to Thee. I 
promise Thee to water and nourish them all by prayer 
and self-denial, so that every time Thou comest into 
my heart Thou mayest find them growing and flourish 
ing more and more. I know, O my God, the work 
of keeping them alive will be difficult to flesh and blood, 



Devotions for Holy Communion 411 

but I am willing to work hard for Thee, and I trust 
also in Thee to water them plentifully with grace as with 
dew from heaven. 

My God, have pity on the poor holy souls in purga 
tory, who are longing to get to Thee longing more 
to see Thy face than to be freed from the fierce flames 
in which Thy justice is obliged to keep them, till their 
debt is paid. I offer Thee the precious blood of Jesus; 
I offer Thee the Sacred Heart of Jesus to pay their debt. 
Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord, and may perpetual 
light shine upon them. 

AT THE PATER NOSTER. 

Say the "Our Father" slowly and devoutly. 

AT THE AGNUS DEI. 

Beg of God once more to forget and. forgive your past negli 
gence and sin, saying: 

r\ SWEET and gentle Son of God, Who wast "led 
^-^ like a lamb to the slaughter without opening Thy 
mouth." O Thou, Whose blood was shed to wash 
away the sins of the world, cleanse my soul once more 
in that saving bath, that it may be pure and bright and 
altogether spotless when Thou comest to take up Thy 
abode within me. May Thy coming bring joy and 
peace to my soul, that peace which the world can not 
give, because it does not possess it. May this holy 
communion not be for my judgment and condemnation, 
but for my pardon and salvation. 

AT THE "DOMINE, NON SUM DIGNUS." 

Humble yourself before God, acknowledging your noth 
ingness and unworthiness. Desire to receive Jesus, your 
dear Lord.

ever done to merit this wonderful favor? I have often 
displeased Thee; yet, though I am not worthy of Thy love 
and condescension, I am truly sorry for having offended 
Thee, and I will approach Thee with hope and confidence, 
because Thou Thyself dost invite me in Thy goodness 
and mercy. I am now about to go to the holy table, 
drawn thither by the sweet attractions of Thy love. 
Oh, I desire most earnestly to receive Thee, my dear 
Lord, in holy communion. 

" Comfort my poor soul distressed; 
Come and dwell within my breast; 
Oh, how oft I sigh for Thee! 
Jesus, Jesus, come to me." 

I place myself in Thy hands, O my God, to do with 
me what Thou wilt. My heart is ready, O my God; 
my heart is ready, and is longing for Thee. Come, 
establish Thy kingdom in my soul ; take possession of 
my heart.

separated from Thee by sin. O Jesus, my God, I 
adere Thee; I believe in Thee; I hope in Thee; I love 
Thee with all my heart. I thank Thee for coming to 
me, a poor sinner. I am truly sorry for having dis 
pleased Thee so often and so grievously. I pray Thee 
to bless me, that I may love Thee and become like Thee

Let my soul, O Lord, feel the sweetness of Thy pres

passionately after worldly pleasures. "Thou art the

cross for love of me. 

How poor a dwelling-place is my heart for Thee, O 
Lord of glory! What is it but a poor human heart, full 
even yet of worldliness and selfish desires? I trust in 
Thee. I pray Thee to drive all selfishness away from it, 
and to leave in it a great desire of pleasing Thee and of 
being kind to others, because they all have souls for 
which Thou didst shed Thy life s blood upon the cross. 
Bless me, O my God, and grant that Thy holy will 
may be done in me and through me for ever. 

Suscipe. 

Take, O Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my 
understanding, and my whole will. Thou hast given me all 
that I am, and all that I possess. I surrender it all to Thee, 
that Thou mayest dispose of it according to Thy will. Give 
me only Thy love and Thy grace; with these I will be rich 
enough, and will have no more to desire. St. Ignatius Loyola.

of living as the brutes that perish. Left to ourselves, 
what would have become of us? We should have

one day admit me, though an unworthy sinner, to be a

Son and the Holy Ghost, art the true light, eternal ful 
ness, everlasting joy, and perfect happiness of all the

BEHOLD, O kind and 
sweetest Jesus, I cast 
myself upon my knees in Thy 
sight, and with the most 
fervent desire of my soul I 
pray and beseech Thee to 
impress upon my heart lively 
sentiments of faith, hope, and 
charity, with true repentence 
for my sins, and a firm purpose 
of amendment, whilst with 
deep affection and grief of 
soul I ponder within myself, 
and mentally contemplate 
Thy five wounds; having 
before my eyes that which 
David spoke in prophecy of 
Thee, O good Jesus: "They 
have pierced My hands and 
My feet ; they have numbered 
all My bones."

petitions ano fferin^s after t&amp;gt;ol 
Communion, 



Thou hast been pleased, most loving Jesus, 
to come and dwell within my heart, I expect 
many favors of Thee; for how canst Thou refuse to 
give me Thy gifts, since Thou hast given me Thyself? 
No, this is not possible, my dearest Lord, and therefore 
I feel the strongest confidence of obtaining all from 
Thy goodness. I confess, O Lord, that I deserve noth 
ing; but the more undeserving I am, the more is Thy 
goodness glorified in bestowing Thy grace upon me. I 
ask, then, O most loving Redeemer, a full pardon and 
remission of the guilt of all my sins, which I once more 
detest and abominate with all my heart; and for the 
remission of the temporal punishment which is due for 
them, I desire to gain all the indulgences I can, and 
beseech Thee to give me the grace to accomplish this 
purpose. 

By Thy most precious blood, by Thy body, soul, and 
divinity, which I have this morning received, I beg of 
Thee with all humility to cleanse my heart from all 



422 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

defilement. Create, O my Jesus, a clean heart within 
me, and grant me a new spirit truly just and upright. 
Fill it with all the gifts of Thy Holy Spirit, and adorn 
it with every virtue, especially with humility, patience, 
meekness, and mortification. Detach my heart from 
all created things, fashion it after Thine own most Sacred 
Heart, and unite it for ever to Thyself in the bonds of 
perfect charity. Give me strength and courage to 
resist bravely all temptations until death; I purpose to 
banish them at once, and promise to avoid every occa 
sion of sin. But, my Lord, Thou knowest that of myself 
I can do nothing, and therefore I implore Thee to help 
me and to strengthen me by Thy blood. 

I beseech Thee to engrave upon my heart so lively a 
remembrance of Thy Passion and death, and the bitter 
sorrows of my Mother Mary, that they may be my con 
tinual meditation night and day; so that henceforth 
and to my last breath I may dwell on Calvary at the 
foot of Thy cross, in company with our dear Lady of 
sorrows. 

I beseech Thee, too, my dearest Lord, most earnestly, 
to give me the grace to free myself once for all from the 
passion which most predominates in me, and the sin I 
most often fall into. (Here mention the particular pas 
sion, or sin, or fault.) I ask moreover for those tem 
poral graces Thou knowest to be most expedient for me, 
for Thy greater glory and the salvation of my soul; and 
lest I should err in asking for what might be injurious 
for me, I leave it entirely to Thee, and trust in Thee, 
Who alone hast goodness and infinite wisdom, to give 
me what Thou knowest to be best for me. To all these 
graces add that highest and most precious gift, the crown 
and perfection of all Thy other gifts, the grace of final 
perseverance. Do Thou, Thyself, my Jesus, ask it of 
Thine eternal Father: show Him Thy wounds; offer 
Him Thy most precious blood, and then I shall be sure 
of being heard. 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 423 

Lastly, I ask Thee, rny Jesus, to give me Thy bless 
ing before Thou leavest me. I recommend my soul to 
Thee during the whole of my life and in the hour of 
death. Every day and hour and moment I am getting 
nearer to that time. Ah! defend me, then, from all 
temptations, and give me grace to overcome them; grant 
me the assistance of my Mother Mary; and oh! do not 
let me, in punishment for my sins, and especially for 
my irreverences toward the Blessed Sacrament and 
my unworthy communions do not let me, I beseech 
Thee, dear Lord, depart this life without having received 
the last sacraments with proper dispositions. 

[You may here add any particular petitions for yourself and 
for your neighbor. Do not forget to pray for the Holy Church, 
the Sovereign Pontiff, and all Superiors, both ecclesiastical 
and secular. Recommend to our dear Lord the regular and 
secular clergy, as also the members of all Religious Orders, 
and pray Him to give them the true spirit of their holy voca 
tion. Pray for your relatives, friends, and benefactors, 
for the afflicted, the sick, and those in their agony. Pray 
for the poor, holy souls in purgatory. Recommend all poor 
sinners, and pray for their conversion and salvation. Do 
not forget to pray for heretics and infidels, beseeching God 
to enlighten them and give them grace to embrace the true 
faith.] 

I should, indeed, be ungrateful, O my Jesus, if after 
Thou hast given me Thyself in this holy communion, I 
were to delay an instant in giving myself entirely to 
Thee. I offer Thee, most loving Lord, my soul, together 
with my liberty. I offer Thee my understanding, that, 
sanctified by Thee, it may be occupied earnestly in 
the consideration of Thy blessed Passion and death, 
and Thy divine attributes. I give Thee my memory, 
that I may ever have in remembrance the infinite mercies 
Thou hast shown me. I give Thee my will, that by 
Thy holy love I may be entirely conformed to Thy 
divine will, desiring nothing but what Thou wiliest,

and rejecting , everything that is displeasing to Thee. 
I give Thee my whole self, to be sanctified by Thee in 
soul and body; and I intend in this offering to make 
an entire, irrevocable, and eternal sacrifice of myself 
and all that belongs to me. I offer and consecrate to 
Thee my poor heart, which now desires to love Thee 
so faithfully as to make amends for all the infidelities 
of my past life. O my Jesus, detach my heart from 
creatures, unite it perfectly to Thine own, and, hiding 
it within the loving wound of Thy side, imprint deeply 
in it the memory of Thy bitter Passion and the sorrows 
of Thy most holy Mother: so that, by frequent medita 
tion on these mysteries, I may be filled with sorrow for 
my past sins, and for the time to come faithfully cor 
respond to Thine infinite love. 

I offer Thee all the senses of my body, particularly 
my eyes and my tongue: grant that henceforth I may 
nevermore offend Thee by them. I offer Thee my 
thoughts, words, and deeds. My Jesus, I desire to 
unite all I have offered Thee to the merits of Thy most 
holy Passion and death, and the merits of my Mother 
Mary and all the saints. I offer Thee the good works 
I have done, as well as those I shall ever do in the whole 
course of my life, and I now make the intention of doing 
and suffering all things for Thy greater glory, in prepa 
ration for holy communion, and in thanksgiving for 
the Most Holy Sacrament. 

Blessed and praised every moment be the Most Holy 
and Most Divine Sacrament! 

REFLECTIONS AFTER COMMUNION. 

fALL to mind, as often as you can during the day, 
that you have received Jesus in the Blessed 
Sacrament. Try to repeat frequently this short sentence: 
"This morning Jesus Christ, the Son of God, condescended 
to come and dwell within me, and gave Himself to me." By 
doing this, you will derive greater fruit from your communion ; 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 425 

you will gain more patience under difficulties, and be more 
careful in keeping the grace of God in your soul; you will 
more easily acquire true and real devotion; you will set 
a good example to others, and have a continual inducement 
to lead a good Christian life, if only you adopt this simple 
practice. 

2. Retire frequently into your heart, in order to renew 
an act of adoration of Jesus, or of thanksgiving for the loving 
visit He made you in the morning, and rekindle the fire of 
divine charity by some holy aspiration. We would not so 
quickly lose the fervor of devotion and the love of God, if 
we took greater pains about this; and Jesus Christ would 
not have to lament the coldness with which men love Him, 
if they only thought oftener of His benefits and His love, 
especially in the Most Holy Sacrament, and thanked Him 
with their whole heart. 

3. Frequently renew the offering of your heart to our 
dear Lord. By giving Himself to you, He desires to gain 
you to His love, and earnestly asks you to give Him your 
heart in exchange for the infinite gift He has bestowed upon 
you. Will you be so ungrateful as to deny Him your heart, 
and to give it to the world and the devil on the very day on 
which He has come to take possession of it? Ah! no; this 
must not be; you have consecrated your heart to Jesus in 
your communion; you must ratify and confirm this offering; 
and if the world, with its enticements, vanities, and false 
pleasures, wishes to enter into your heart, say that you have 
given it for ever to Jesus. If the devil with his suggestions, 
an i the flesh with its temptati ns, assail your heart, a swer 
generously and courageously that you 1 ave given it to esus, 
to be His and His alone and for ever. Oh, if all Christians 
were but to do this after their communion, they would pre 
serve the grace of God, an not relapse into sin. 

4. Remember that your tongue h s received Jesus, th t 
it has touched His sacred body when ou went to com 
munion. Only recall this thought to mind when you feel 
tempted to speak impatiently, or so as to offend or injure 
your neighbor; and surely it will keep you from offending 
Jesus with that tongue which has been sanctified by the 
touch of His sacred flesh. 

5. In connection with your visits to the Blessed Sacrament 



426 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

every day make a spiritual communion, renewing in the most 
lively manner your desire to receive our dear Lord into your 
heart. Remember, for love of us Jesus remains night and 
day in the tabernacle, ardently desiring to communicate Him 
self to our souls, and bestow His graces upon us. Ah! what 
monstrous forgetfulness and ingratitude, if, when we can 
easily do so, we neglect to go to Him during the day, to pay 
our homage and adoration to Him in return for all His love.*

AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MASS. 

YOU have now received from the tender mercy of your 
divine Redeemer the greatest and sweetest proof of 
His wondrous love. Surely your heart is overflowing with 
gratitude and affection. To give evidence of this gratitude, 
and to give expression to this affection, you can do nothing 
better, nothing more acceptable to God, than to assist again 
at the adorable sacrifice of the altar, thus offering to the 
Almighty the only Victim of thanksgiving proportionate to 
the benefits which you have received. 

OGOD! " how hast Thou multiplied Thy mercies" 
in favor of Thy poor servant. When was I ever 
so rich as at present? "What shall I render to the 
Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me? 
I will take the chalice of salvation; I will pay my vows 
to the Lord before all His people; I will sacrifice to 
Thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the 
name of the Lord, in the courts of the house of the 
Lord." (Psalm cxv. 12-18.) 

I am indeed fully conscious, O Lord, of my personal 
indigence, and my utter unworthiness to be among Thy 
chosen ones in this holy place, yet, transported with 
gratitude for the dignity to which I am raised by the

sacred bonds, which unite me to my Saviour, I will 
again offer Thee, O King of heaven and earth, a worthy 
sacrifice, a Victim of thanksgiving, commensurate with 
Thy gifts. I will offer Thee a host of praise, im 
molated not only on this altar, but in the midst of my 
heart. 

And Thou, O Jesus! "sweet and mild, and plenteous 
in mercy " (Ps. Ixxxv. 5), give ear to my earnest petition; 
let me be now so closely united to Thee that I may 
become one with Thee, and thus be enabled to offer 
my whole being a sacrifice worthy of the God to whose 
glory Thou art about to be immolated; create within 
me that humble, meek, and fervent heart, which will 
make me pleasing and acceptable in Thy sight; let 
Thy divine presence fill my soul with consolation and 
peace, and let Thy mercies be now upon me, "according 
to the hope I have placed in Thee." I ask of Thee, O 
Lord, a constant sense of Thy divine presence, that I 
may walk before Thee, and be perfect. 

OFFERING OF THE BLESSED MARGARET MARY.

all the desires, all the sentiments, all the affections, all 
the beatings, all the actions of this Sacred Heart. They 
are all mine, since He immolates Himself for me; and 
I desire, for the future, never to have any other inten

sins, and in thanksgiving for all Thy benefits. Receive 
them, and grant me, through their merits, all the graces 
that are necessary for me, and particularly the grace of 
final perseverance. Receive them as so many acts of 
love, adoration, and praise, which I offer to Thy divine 
Majesty, since it is by Him alone that Thou art worthilv 
honored and glorified. Amen.

"*T*S not He thy Father, that hath possessed thee, and

"You are not your own, you are bought with a great 
price." (i Cor. vi.) 

"You are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God 
dwelleth in you." (i Cor. iii.) 

To whom, my God, do I belong if not to You ? Who 
else has a shadow of right to me ? I am Yours by crea 
tion, by redemption, by sanctification. I am Yours 
by the vows of my profession. And how have You 
treated one who is Yours by so many titles? Have 
You loved me ? Have You given me cause to love You ? 
Love is shown by deeds, by the communication :&amp;gt;f good 
things. Will Your love bear this test, my God? Oh, 
let the history of Your benefits to me throughout my 
life speak for You that hidden history of Your deal 
ings with my soul, the significance of which I could not 
make known to others, even if I would the opportu 
nities, the help in need, the persistent drawing aid 
waiting which make up the history of my life.

" No earthly father loves like Thee, 

No mother half so mild 
Bears and forbears, as Thou hast done, 
With me Thy sinful child." 

I have cause indeed to love, and I tell You again 
and again that I love You, my God and my all. But 
where are the proofs? Love is shown by deeds. In 
deed and in truth You have loved ni5. But where 
are the proofs of my love ? Resolutions in plenty every 
morning. But when the evening comes what have I 
to show, what have I to offer but weaknesses, cowardices, 
and failures. And yet I love You, dearest Lord. I 
wish to please You; forgive me my unfaithfulness. 
You have created me; You know my weaknesses and 
my struggles have mercy on me; help me to love You 
better; help me to follow You more closely. Take my 
heart, and make it like Your Heart meek and humble. 
I shall try to accept my failures in a deeply humbk 
spirit; I shall not yield to discouragement, but trusting 
in Your goodness, in Your love and Your grace, I shall 
endeavor daily to overcome my weaknesses, and fight 
on calmly, courageously, generously, and hopefully to 
the end. O Lord, I am willing to go on still struggling 
fighting hard constantly to the last moment of my 
life ; and even to fail constantly, to have nothing to show 
but defeat and failures, provided only that You are 
glorified. Omnia ad Majorem Dei gloriam.

servant, offer unto Thee, my living and true God, for 
my innumerable sins, offences, and negligences, and 
for all here present, as also for all faithful Christians, 
both living and dead, that it may be profitable for my 
own and for their salvation unto life eternal. Amen.

of Thy divine majesty it may ascend with the odor of 
sweetness for our salvation and for that of the whole

V/hen the Priest washes his fingers, say with him 
THE LAVABO. 

I WILL wash my hands among the innocent, and 
will compass Thy altar, O Lord: that I may hear 
the voice of praise and tell of all Thy marvellous works. 
I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house, and the 
place where Thy glory dwelleth. Take not away my 
soul, O God, with the wicked, nor my life with bloody 
men. In whose hands are iniquities; their right hand 
is filled with gifts. As for me, I have walked in my 
innocence; redeem me and have mercy upon me. My 
foot hath stood in the right path; in the churches I will 
bless Thee, O Lord. Glory be to the Father, etc. 

When the Priest bows before the altar, say:

in honor of Blessed Mary, ever virgin, of blessed John 
the Baptist, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, of these

to intercede for us in heaven, whose memory we cele

AT THE PREFACE. 

IT is truly meet and just, right and salutary, that we 
should always and in all places give thanks to 
Thee, O Lord, Father almighty, eternal God, since by 
the mystery of the Word made flesh a new ray of Thy 
glory has appeared to the eyes of our souls; that, while 
we behold God visibly, we may be carried by Him to 
the love of things invisible; and therefore, with the 
angels and archangels, with the thrones and dominations, 
and with all the heavenly host, we sing our everlasting 
hymn to Thy glory, saying: 

AT THE SANCTUS. 

i OLY, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth, heaven 
and earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the 
highest!

the love which the Almighty has this day manifested

Christ loves all, and did not refuse to lay down His life foi 
them. 

O DIVINE Jesus! the Redeemer of all mankind! 
Who art come to save even those who were lost! 
Whose adorable blood was shed for many to the remis 
sion of sins! deign to listen to the prayers I now offer, 
not for myself alone, but for all mankind, Whose Crea 
tor, Lord, and Sovereign Master Thou art: permit 
me to offer my supplications for the peace and prosperity 
of that Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, which 
was founded on Thy unerring word, established by 
Thy miracles, enriched by Thy merits, and made illus 
trious by Thy saints; of that Church, whose unworthy 
child I am, in whose bosom, through Thy grace, I re 
solve to live and die; that Church, which has this day 
imparted to me her most precious treasure, in giving 
me the adorable body and blood of her heavenly Spouse. 
O my God! bless, sanctify, and protect the Pope, Thy 
representative on earth; have mercy on the bishops, 
priests, Religious, and all who labor in Thy vineyard; 
animate them with zeal for the salvation of souls, who 
are the purchase of Thy blood; give them humility, 
purity, prudence, patience, and perseverance; inflame 
their hearts with that ardent zeal which consumed Thy 
holy apostles. Render their lives as holy as the law 
they inculcate; make them all according to Thine own di 
vine Heart, and let their light so shine before men, that 
they, seeing their good works, may " glorify their Father 
Who is in heaven " (Matt. v. 16). Bless our Holy 
Institute; bless our friends, our relatives, our benefac 
tors, all those who have asked us to pray for them, and 
for whom we have promised to pray. Bless in particular 
those who, by prayer and good works, are fostering and 
propagating devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. 

SWEETEST Jesus, Redeemer of mankind, be-

belong to Thee; I wish to be Thine; I dedicate myself 
to Thy most Sacred Heart. O my Lord, I seek not 
that which is profitable to myself, but to many ; that they 
may be saved (i Cor. x. 33). Many have never known 
Thee. Many, despising Thy commands, have rejected 
Thee. Have pity on them, most merciful Jesus, and 
draw all men to Thy Sacred Heart. Rule, O Lord, not 
only over the faithful who never have gone away from 
Thee, but also over the prodigal sons who have forsaken 
Thee; and make them return quickly to their Father s 
house, lest they perish of misery and hunger. Rule 
over those who have been misled by error, or separated 
by schism; and call them back to the haven of truth 
and the unity of faith, so that there may soon be one fold 
and one Shepherd. Lastly, rule over all who are sunk 
in the old superstition of the Gentiles, and vouchsafe to 
bring them out of darkness into the light and kingdom 
of God. 

Give to Thy Church, O Lord, safety and liberty; give 
to all nations peace and order; and grant that, over the 
whole earth, from pole to pole, may resound the words: 
Praise be to the divine Heart, through which was 
brought to us salvation ; glory and honor be to it for ever. 
Amen.

COMMEMORATION OF THE DEAD. 

O ALMIGHTY God! the resurrection and the life! 
he that believeth in Thee, even though he were 
dead, shall certainly live, and enjoy in Thy kingdom 
the true liberty of the children of God. Look then, I 
beseech Thee, with compassion and mercy on those suffer 
ing souls who have always believed and confessed Thy 
name. O sovereign Lord, remember that they are 
"the work of Thine own hands " (Job x. 3); created in 
Thy power, redeemed in Thy mercy, preserved in Thy 
goodness, and formed to Thine adorable image. Ah! 
why then hidest Thou Thine adorable face from those 
who have been dear to Thy Sacred Heart, and who long 
to behold and enjoy Thee, their sovereign Beatitude? 
Accept, O eternal God! in their favor, the adorable 
Victim, Who now offers Himself to Thee on this altar, 
and Whom I likewise possess in the center of my soul. 
Apply to them also, O Lord, the indulgence which Thy 
Church this day holds forth in Thy name to worthy 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 439 

communicants, and let not my imperfect dispositions 
be an obstacle to the exercise of Thy mercy on their 
behalf. In consideration of Thy beloved Son, cease 
to remember their iniquities, and take no further re 
venge of their sins. I particularly implore Thy mercy, 
O Lord! for my parents, friends, and benefactors; for 
all those who are most abandoned; for those to whose 
sufferings I may have been accessory; for all who, 
during life, were most devoted to the Adorable Sacrament 
of Thy love, and also for those who were the fervent 
clients of Thy blessed Mother, for priests and Religious, 
and in particular for the deceased members of our Order. 
O almighty Lord! transport them into Thy bosom, 
where they shall be replenished with the goods of Thy 
house; confirm them in Thy sight forever, that they 
may " joyfully sing a hymn to Thee in Sion, and pay to 
Thee a vow in Jerusalem" (Ps. Ixiv. i). 

AT THE PATER NOSTER. 

After repeating with the priest the Pater Noster, call to 
mind the indulgence which the prodigal son experienced 
from his father on his sincere return, and acknowledge 
with gratitude that the tenderness of his good parent has 
been infinitely surpassed in your favor by your heavenly 
Father.

SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

ENEW your desire to receive Our Lord frequently 
during the day. 

The Blessed Margaret Mary once said to her divine Spouse: 



440 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

"My most loving Jesus, I wish to be consumed with the desire 
of Thee and since I can not receive Thee now I will not cease 
to desire Thee." To which Our Lord answered: "I take 
so much pleasure in being desired, that as many times as 
the heart forms this desire, so often do I look upon it lovingly 
to attract it to Myself." Let us often give this pleasure to 
our merciful Saviour, that we may reap from it the sweet 
fruit that He promises. 

/T\Y Jesus, I most firmly believe that Thou art really 
* fc i- present in the Blessed Sacrament. I place in 
Thee my whole confidence, and I love Thee above all 
things. Oh! that I had never offended Thee! I ar 
dently desire to be united to Thee, my loving Saviour, 
and never to be separated from Thee. What have I in 
heaven, and besides Thee what do I desire upon earth! 
Veni, Domine Jesu. 

Act of Atonement. 

/T\Y Father in heaven, I offer unto Thee Thy Son 
r**^ Jesus Christ in atonement for my sins, and for 
the sins of the world. 

Look on Him, O my Father; He raises His hands to 
Thee; He is pleading for us all. 

Listen to Him, Father in heaven. He asks Thee 
for pity and for pardon. He is Thine own beloved 
Son, in Whom Thou art well pleased. Thou canst 
not refuse Him anything. Do not let Him ask in 
vain. 

He has paid dearly for us, O God. Remember His 
sighs, His tears, His sweat of blood, His scourging and 
the cruel pangs He suffered for us on Calvary. For 
His sake, pity and pardon us. 

Through Him, and with Him, and in Him, I offer 
Thee, O eternal Father, humblest adoration and thanks. 
Through Him, and with Him, and in Him, I make 
atonement for the sins of the world, and I implore Thy 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 441 

mercy and grace for myself and for all poor sinners, 
through the same Jesus Christ Thy Son. Amen. 

O wondrous Love! would that men knew Thee. 
How sweet Thou art, O Lord, how good to those who 
love Thee! Bless me, that I may love Thee more, and 
serve Thee faithfully to the end. 

Act oj Consecration, 

Thee, O Jesus, I consecrate my heart. In Thy 
Sacred Heart I wish to live. In Thy Sacred 
Heart I wish to die. 

Inflame my heart with the fire of Thy love, and en 
lighten me with Thy wisdom and Thy knowledge. 

Oh, let Thy loving Heart be to me my strength in 
temptation and my consolation in the day of tribulation 
and sorrow. Grant me grace, dear Jesus, ever to taste 
the sweetness of Thy Sacred Heart, not only during my 
lifetime, but, above all, at the hour of my death. Ameh. 

Will You be True? 

^TTT KEN you go to your holy communion, think that yot 
vxA. see the divine Child looking through and through 
you with His clear, pellucid gaze, and asking you the ques 
tion, " Will you be true ? " Are you resolved to combat reso 
lutely the visible faults all can "see and be scandalized by, in 
stead of the half-dozen imaginary ones with which you love 
so much to torture yourselves? And I should love, I should 
dearly love you to return His glance with one as limpid and 
as true, saying, " O Lord, no one knows better than I how 
blind and weak I am, but I wish to know, I wish to see, 
what Thou desirest of me, and will try with all my heart, re 
gardless of all obstacles, to accomplish it." He wishes you to 
be real. Be real. 

Final Petitions. 

E is your Master, Christ" (Matt, xxiii.). In 
two ways, Lord, You are my Master. You are 
not Teacher only, You are owner. I am not merely 



442 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

Your disciple, I am Your indisputable property. Thanks 
be to God that it is so. All that I have and am belongs 
to You time, talents, labor, health, life, all the senses 
of my body, all the faculties of my soul. Take them, 
O Lord, they are Yours, to You I restore them. See 
that I do not misuse any one of them. See that I use 
them all with a pure intention for Your glory, for Your 
greater glory choosing the means which most tend to 
the end for which I was created, by which I may love 
and follow You more closely. 

Have pity, O Lord and Master, on the poor, the 
suffering, the tempted, the uncared-for little ones; on 
the teeming races of the poor heathen all the world 
over; on all those who are in their agony. Let me 
make use of Your visits of mercy in this acceptable time 
in these days of salvation my communion days. I 
desire nothing so much as to love You. Give me Your 
love and Your grace, and this is enough for me. Increase 
and invigorate my faith, that it may be productive of 
great things to Your glory. 

Stay with me, Lord, that from communion to com 
munion I may ascend from virtue to virtue, and become 
more pleasing in Your sight. 

Have pity, Lord, on the multitudes who never think 
of You as Judge, on those outside the Church who 
have but a dim belief in the judgment to come, and on 
those children of the Church who, believing firmly that 
it is coming and coming fast, think of it and prepare 
for it no more than if they did not believe. Remember, 
O Lord, that You "will have all men to be saved" 
(i Tim. ii.), and that You died for all, and since the 
"whole earth is made desolate because there is none 
that considereth in his heart " (Jer. xii.), stir up faith 
in the hearts of all men. Give to all a living and prac 
tical faith in the judgment to come, that they may pre 
pare for it while there is yet time.

Indulgenced Prayer. 

AR Jesus, in the Sacrament of the Altar, be forever 
thanked and praised. Love, worthy of all celes 
tial and terrestrial love! Who, out of infinite love for 
me, ungrateful sinner, didst assume our human nature, 
didst shed Thy most precious blood in the cruel scourg 
ing, and didst expire on a shameful cross for our eternal 
welfare! Now, illumined with lively faith, with the 
outpouring of my whole soul and the fervor of my heart, 
I humbly beseech Thee, through the infinite merits of 
Thy painful sufferings, give me strength and coura-ge to 
destroy every evil passion which sways my heart, to 
bless Thee in my greatest afflictions, to glorify Thee by 
the exact fulfilment of all my duties, supremely to hate 
all sin, and thus to become a saint. 

Indulgence of 100 days, once a day. Pius IX., Jan. i, 
1866. 

flfceDttations after Communion. 

FIRST MEDITATION. 

On the Sentiments -which the Holy Communion should 
produce in our Souls. 

i. fS" ONSIDER with astonishment the excessive liber- 
^l ality with which Jesus Christ has treated you; 
by this one communion you are infinitely elevated above 
all that the world calls great you are happier than if 
you enjoyed all the delights of the universe richer 
than if you possessed all its treasures and more privi 
leged than if you were its sole sovereign. Ah! if you 
understood the gift of God, if you had a just idea of 
your own dignity, how soon would you despise every 
thing in this world! Penetrated with gratitude for 
the greatness of the benefit you have received, you would 
exclaim with the Royal Prophet: What shall I render 



444 Petitions and Offerings after ffoly Communion. 

to the Lord for all He has done for me? how shall i 
testify my gratitude? Do not on this important matter 
deceive yourself as many do. Do not imagine that so 
great a benefit as a communion is worthily acknowl 
edged by the most fervent expressions of thanksgiving. 
It is not those who say: " Lord, Lord," that shall enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. "Sincere gratitude for 
any benefit," says St. Thomas, "consists chiefly in 
esteeming the benefit as it deserves, and in endeavoring 
to make our benefactor an adequate return." 

Give glory to Him Who has given you His precious 
body and blood, His soul and divinity, and has thus 
rendered you, in a way, an object of envy to tne angels 
themselves. Beg of God most earnestly to enlighten 
your mind, that you may understand the greatness of 
the favor conferred on you; and also to touch your heart, 
that you may feel your obligation of acknowledging it 
by every means in your power, especially by a greater 
love of the Blessed Sacrament, and a more self-sacrific 
ing devotedness to your duties as a Religious. 

2. Cast yourself in spirit at the feet of your Creator, 
and present to Him the sacrifice of thanksgiving which 
He deserves: A voluntary, unreserved oblation of your 
whole being. Can that be too much for Him Who has 
created you to His image and likeness, and redeemed 
you with His precious blood? or rather, what can be 
enough for Him Who has loved you so much as to give 
Himself to you? If you would really and entirely be 
long to God, you should make a twofold sacrifice: A 
sacrifice of your body with all its senses, and of your 
heart and soul with all their powers and affections. 
First, you should consecrate your body to God; that is, 
you should in future bear in mind the union you have 
contracted with God, and respect in yourself the temple 
of the divinity a temple of which He has so lately 
taken possession; consecrated by His presence, purified 
by His blood, and enriched with the most precious gifts 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 445 

of His holy spirit. This is the sacrifice to which St. 
Paul exhorts all Christians, but particularly communi 
cants, when he says: "I beseech you, brethren, by the 
mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sac 
rifice, holy, pleasing to God " (Rom. xii. i). Reflect 
also, that as a material temple is not alone consecrated 
to God internally but is known before it is entered to 
be a house of God by its external appearance ; so should 
your modesty and Christian deportment manifest to 
every one that you are really consecrated to God, and 
become the living temple of Jesus Christ. St. Chrysos 
torn says: "It is not just that those eyes which have be 
held the divine and sacred Host should afterwards 
delight in the vanity and idle follies of the world that 
those lips, which received and touched the God of 
heaven, should ever be profaned by frivolous discourses 
that your tongue, on which the body of Jesus Christ re 
posed, should ever become mstrumental in lessening 
the reputation of others, or in wounding charity." 
Present your resolutions to God through the glorious 
Queen of virgins. Set before your eyes, and resolve in 
every action of your life, to imitate this incomparable 
model whom St. Anselm describes as having "nothing 
disagreeable in her looks, nothing inconsistent in her 
words, nothing imprudent in her actions; whose deport 
ment was. not assuming; whose voice was not loud or 
arrogant; and whose exterior modesty was a finished 
portrait of her interior purity." O most blessed Virgin, 
take me under thy protection, and preserve me from 
defiling by sin the temple of thy beloved Son. 

3. Consider that your immortal soul was created by 
God for Himself, stamped with His own sacred image, 
redeemed with His blood, adorned with His graces, en 
riched with His merits, and often strengthened with 
that Sacrament of life which you have so lately received. 
Great then must be its value, since God Himself did 
not think it too dearly purchased by the blood of His 



446 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

only Son. Yes, you can not be too deeply convinced 
that your immortal soul is your great and only treasure; 
lo save your soul no pains can be excessive, no security 
too great; if that be lost, all is lost; and if you be 
so happy as to save your soul, though you lose all 
the rest, all is well; the kingdom of heaven is gained. 
"What will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, 
and lose his own soul?" (Matt. xvi. 26). What does 
it now avail any of the damned, to have been on earth 
honored, loved, respected, endowed with beauty, talents, 
wit, or accomplishments, or to have been the idols or 
envy of all around them ? Alas ! what does all that avail 
them now, since they burn and will burn in hell for all 
eternity? Oh! let their irreparable misfortune ani 
mate you to struggle against your passions, and to lead 
a virtuous life. O my Jesus, deign to enlighten me 
that I may see the vanity of aD. worldly goods. Thou 
hast given Thyself entirely to me; I now give myself 
entirely to Thee. I desire that my whole soul may be 
Thine; my body, my powers, my senses, that all may 
be employed in serving and pleasing Thee. To Thee I 
consecrate all my thoughts, my desires, my affections, 
and my whole life. Grant me the gift of holy persever 
ance in Thy service, and the grace of a happy death. O 
eternal Father, Thy beloved Son Jesus has promised 
that Thou wilt give me whatsoever I ask of Thee in 
His name: "If you ask the Father anything in My 
name, He will give it you " (John xvi. 23). In the 
name therefore, and through the merits of this Thy Son, 
I ask Thee for Thy love and for holy perseverance, that 
I may one day come to love Thee in heaven with all 
my powers, and to sing for ever Thy mercies, safe from 
all danger of being ever again separated from Thee. 

O most holy Mary, my Mother, obtain for me these 
graces which I so much desire.

SECOND MEDITATION. 

On the Imitation of Jesus Christ. 

i. /CONSIDER attentively that one of the chief 
^-4 ends for which Jesus gives Himself to us in 
the holy communion is to unite us to Himself, and to 
make us one with Him: "He that eateth My flesh, 
and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in Him " 
(John vi. 57). St. Thomas teaches that in the Holy 
Eucharist Jesus Christ applies His most sacred body 
like a seal on the heart of man, to revive that image of 
the divinity to which we were created, that He trans 
forms us into Himself, by imprinting on our soul the 
image of His adorable perfections and by infusing into 
our heart abundant graces to imitate His virtues. To 
become a perfect imitation of Jesus Christ, you should 
conform your judgment, your opinions, your ideas, 
your heart, feelings, and all your affections, to those 
of your divine Lord. The thoughts of Jesus were 
always directed to God, or bent on something relative 
to the glory of God. How do you act in this respect? 
Be convinced that a frequent recollection of God would 
be the best guard you could have against those thoughts 
of vanity or pride which are so common, and so sinful 
when indulged in. Jesus Christ judged all things as 
God judges them: His adorable Heart, inflamed with 
love for God and desire for His glory, was incapable 
of a single sentiment of joy, of sorrow, of fear, of hope, 
of consolation, or sadness, except as the interests, the 
glory, the worship of His heavenly Father were con 
cerned. Be ashamed of the trifles with which you 
have hitherto been delighted, or the insignificant inci 
dents at which you have been grieved. O my divine 
and adorable Master, instead of looking on all things 
as Thou seest them, and as I myself shall see them after 
death, I have consulted my interests, my passions, 
my imagination, and the corrupt maxims of the worldj 



448 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

in forming my opinions and ideas. I have unfortu 
nately sought after those very things which Thou dids 
shun I loved what Thou didst hate I have hated 
what Thou didst love. Thou didst pronounce those 
blessed and happy who suffer, and I have been so impa 
tient under sufferings; Thou didst despise and flee 
from the honors of this world, and I have desired and 
esteemed them as great advantages. O my God, en 
lighten me to see and detest my folly. 

2. Consider the example which Jesus Christ gives 
you in His sacred childhood. "Jesus advanced in 
wisdom and age, and grace with God and men" (Luke 
ii. 52). Our divine Redeemer, from the first moment 
of His Incarnation, had indeed the plenitude of grace, 
of wisdom, and of virtue, incapable of any increase; 
but outwardly He, as it were, progressed, conforming 
His sacred actions and discourses suitably to His age. 
Learn from this that, as every day, every hour, the Al 
mighty adds to your life, so should every grace, every 
instruction you receive, advance you in the road of 
solid virtue. In particular, every time you have the 
happiness of receiving holy communion, you should 
grow, like Jesus, in grace and wisdom before God and 
men: that is, God should discern in your heart, and 
those with whom you associate should witness in your 
conduct, an increase of the fear and love of God. Those 
faults and failings which were excusable some years 
ago, before you were admitted into a Religious Com 
munity, become more serious now. Examine whether 
you may not unfortunately have lost much of the fervor 
with which you first approached the Adorable* Eucharist, 
and never forget that not to go forward in virtue is to 
go back. 

Jesus Christ, while yet a child, is found among the 
Doctors in the Temple, asking them questions and 
listening to the word of God with profound veneration. 
Did the eternal Son of God, the Fountain of all knowl- 



Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 449 

edge, require instruction ? Was there anything for Him 
to learn, or any person on earth who could teach Him ? 
Certainly not; but on this occasion He would teach you 
with what ardor you should seek after instruction- 
how thankfully and respectfully you should receive 
; t h ow highly you should value an opportunity of 
hearing the word of God. The chief virtue which 
characterized the youth of Jesus Christ was obedi 
ence. He has scarcely permitted any other account 
of His early years to reach us, than: that He was sub 
ject to His blessed Mother and His reputed father, 
St. Joseph. He obeyed them in all things, at all 
times, with cheerfulness and exactness. To imitate 
your adorable Model in this important point, you must 
resolve to respect and love your Superiors; to submit 
to their authority with docility and with confidence, 
because they are deputed by God to command you, and 
have received light to direct your inexperience. Re 
member that Jesus Christ was not less submissive to 
the orders of Herod, one of the most wicked of men, 
than He was to those of His blessed Mother, the most 
perfect of creatures; because it was God alone Whom 
He obeyed in all superiors. Impress this lesson on your 
mind, and guard against a fault so common to world 
lings: of obeying only those who may please you, and 
totally forgetting that duty with regard to others. If 
you do not respect the authority of God in all your 
Superiors; if you do not love God in them all you can 
never acquire the virtue of obedience. O Jesus, my 
God, infuse into my heart the virtues of Thy divine child 
hood Thy purity, simplicity, obedience, and docility, 
penetrate my soul with the horror Thou hadst of sin, 
that I may dread it as the only real evil, the only obstacle 
to my resembling Thee. 

3. Consider the hidden life of Jesus Christ during 
thirty years of subjection and labor. Contemplate 
the Incarnate Word at Nazareth, and consider with 



450 Petitions and Offerings after Holy Communion. 

astonishment that He Who has descended from heaven 
to instruct, convert, and save the whole universe, passes 
the greater part of His life in seclusion; showing not 
otherwise the perfection of the divinity which resides 
in Him than by obeying His parents, serving and assist 
ing them, and fulfilling in all things the will of His 
heavenly Father. The accomplishment of that ador 
able will is the only object of His desires : it is so necessary 
to His happiness that He Himself declares it to be His 
food, the support of His existence, the end of His mis 
sion on earth. Learn from the hidden life of Jesus, 
that lesson of perfect conformity to the will of God, by 
which alone you can resemble Him, and attain true 
sanctity. Resolve, in every stage of your life, to place 
all your perfection in being about the business of your 
heavenly Father; that is, in faithfully discharging the 
duties which Providence has allotted you, whatever 
they may be. 

The public life of our divine Lord was a series of 
miracles and wonders, and the lessons which He never 
ceased to preach to the world by word and example were 
those of humility, patience, mortification, meekness, 
and charity. St. Francis de Sales calls charity the pecul 
iar fruit of a good communion. Charity was a favorite 
virtue of Jesus the virtue to which He sacrificed His 
life the virtue by which He would have His real fol 
lowers distinguished. Resolve, then, that the fruits of 
your having been so lately united to the God of charity 
should appear evident by your gentleness, patience, 
forbearance, silence on the defects of others, and en 
deavors to serve and oblige ail, particularly those who 
may appear to you least amiable or deserving. Con 
clude this meditation by fervently and humbly begging 
of God to impress the truths it contains so deeply on 
your heart that your ideas and conduct may, in future, 
be happily regulated by them.

From sins caused in others; 

From sins of omission; 

From the stain of daily faults: 

Faults of pride, 

Faults of self-indulgence, 

Faults of worldliness. 

And may it cleanse the souls of all that are in sin,

PASSIO CHRISTI, CONFORTA ME.

ACTS OF FAITH AND ADORATION. 

Y sweet Jesus, I believe with a firm and lively faith, 
that in this Adorable Sacrament are Thy body 
and blood, soul and divinity. I believe that in this 
consecrated Host I shall receive that same body which 
was born of the most pure Virgin Mary, which suffered 
so many pains and torments for love of me on the cross, 
and which rose gloriously the third day from the dead. 
I believe that I shall receive that most holy soul which 
is enriched with all the treasures of the Divinity; that 
I shall receive God Himself. 

I adore Thee, O my God, as my Creator, Preserver^ 
Redeemer, and my Judge, truly present in the Holy 
Eucharist. But do Thou strengthen my faith, and 
animate it with deeper sentiments of adoration and 
love.

ACT OF CONTRITION. 

OMY God, I detest all the sins of my whole life 
because they displease Thee, and especially I 
am heartily sorry for those which I have committed 
against this Divine Sacrament, by the irreverence and 
the little profit I have drawn from so many communions, 
by my negligence in guarding my senses, particularly 
my tongue, which has been so often consecrated by Thy 
divine presence, and has been sullied by so many sins. 

O divine Jesus, what confusion I feel at beholding 
myself so unworthy to approach Thy holy table. Suffer 
me, dear Jesus, to seek the remedy for my evils in the 
wound of Thy Sacred Heart, that this adorable Heart, 
which can not endure the slightest stain, may imprint 
on mine a horror and fear of the smallest offence. Let 
Thy Sacred Heart be to me as the burning coal which 
purified the lips of Isaias; place it, all inflamed with 
charity, I beseech Thee, dear Lord, on my heart, my 
tongue, my senses, and all the powers of my soul, so 
that it may burn and annihilate all that is displeasing 
to Thee. 

ACTS OF HUMILITY AND CONFIDENCE.

miserable petitioner, you are now rich and can offer a gift 
infinite in value. For what will you offer it? Know what 
you are about, and do not spend the time in doing nothing 
for want of a method. Realize Who is within you and as 
soon as your devotion flags use a book, if only for two min

to Thee my attachment to my own will, I sacrifice those 
eager desires to be esteemed and loved by others, my 
impetuous and hasty temper, that human respect which 
has so often been the mainspring of my actions, and 
those warm attachments and natural friendships which 
have occupied my mind and heart. I resolve hence 
forth to act only for Thee, to seek only to please Thee, 
that my mind, my heart, and my soul may acknowledge 
Thee forever as their only King and sovereign Master. 

ACT OF PETITION. 

BESEECH Thee most earnestly, dear Jesus, to 
destroy in me all that is displeasing to Thee. 
Help me to overcome my passions; make me strong 
against temptation ; give me grace to correct that special

am, I come full of confidence to Thee, my tender Father, 
sure that by the merits of Thy precious blood Thou 
wilt enrich my poverty. Oh! most bountiful Jesus, 
give me purity of soul and body, profound contrition 
and humility, fortitude, patience, charity, and fervent 
zeal and unbounded confidence in Thee. Direct me 
in all my undertakings, enlighten my mind, strengthen 
my resolutions, and confirm my will: give me, dear 
Jesus, the spirit of my state, and grant me grace to 
observe with fidelity my holy vows, which I here 
renew. . . .

and guide me at all times and in all events, that so I

and nations, and that Thy will may be perfectly accom 
plished. Amen.

self entirely in Thy hands; do with me according to 
Thy pleasure. With St. Ignatius, I pray: "Give me 
but Thy love and Thy grace; more than this I do not 
ask;" and with the seraphic Francis, I cry to Thee:

me, let me also die to self for love of Thee." 

PETITION. 

J7ESUS, my Lord, since Thou hast come to me to 
J grant me graces, bidding me to ask with confi 
dence, I now pray Thee not for earthly riches, honors, 
and transitory pleasures, but for the greatest spiritual 
treasures, namely, a supernatural horror of sin, and 
intense sorrow for past offences, freedom from inordi 
nate affections, a meek and humble heart like Thine, 
the most perfect submission and even abandonment to 
Thy will, a holy life and a happy death. Help me to 
live daily more perfectly in accordance with the spirit 
of my vows, and that I may persevere as a true and 
zealous Religious to the end of my days. 

I have also some particular graces to ask for (mention 
them). O heavenly Father! since our dear Lord and

Saviour Himself has said: "Amen, amen, I say to you, 
if you ask the Father anything in My name, He will

infinite merits I offer up to Thee, do Thou graciously 
hear my prayers and grant all my petitions.

themselves to the salvation of souls. 

2. My relatives, friends, and enemies; the dying 
who are on the point of leaving this world; and all the 
faithful who are in Thy grace; give them, O Lord,

nothing my own! May the Most Holy Sacrament be 
evermore thanked and praised! Blessed be the holy 
and immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 
"My son, give Me thy heart" (Prov. xiii. 26). O my 
soul, behold this is all that thy Lord asks of thee; when 
He comes to visit thee, He would have thy heart and 
thy will. He gives Himself to thee without reserve; 
it is but reasonable that thou shouldst also give Him 
all thyself without reserve, taking care to follow His 
will in all things: "For the Lord will return, to rejoice 
over thee in all good things" (Deut. xxx. 9). Act in 
such a manner that Jesus, when He comes to thee again, 
may find that thou hast executed all His designs. My 
Jesus! I wish to please Thee; help Thou my desire. 
Give me strength, and do with me whatsoever Thou 
pleasest. 

" When life is o er to me He ll say, 

Arise, my love, the winter s past; 
The rains have ceased, come haste away,

Upon His Heart, in His embrace, 
I ll sweetly rest eternally." 

A PETITION TO OVERCOME YOUR FAULTS. 

EAR Jesus, Thou knowest my special weaknesses, 
and how earnestly I have asked Thee to strengthen 



me. 



But there are other failings, and these I petition Thee 
to help me in a particular manner to overcome. 

I wince and chafe when I am found fault with, even 
when the reproach is just. 

It is like a lancet cutting me to be misunderstood, 
and to have my intentions and actions misrepresented. 

But to be accused falsely and before many, to be 
branded with motives and deeds which I would spurn, 



Various Exercises for Holy Communion. 477 

well-nigh paralyzes me, and tempts me to bitterness of 
heart and revenge. 

While seeing others preferred before me, being de 
rided and held up to scorn rouses all the worst feelings 
and passions of my nature with such force that I am well- 
nigh carried away by their violence. 

I feel it so hard, sometimes almost impossible, to be 
kind to those who have treated me treacherously and 
with ingratitude, and my thoughts, words, and ges 
tures are poisoned with dislike when they come across 
me. 

I strive to cast the injury they have done me from 
my mind, and to treat them with more kindness than 
before, but the struggle seems hopeless. 

And in this way I am so utterly unlike Thee, Whom 
I have received in holy communion, Whose disciple 
I am, and Whose follower I pretend to be, that I entreat 
Thee to change me, that I may imitate closely Thy 
beautiful example. 

Jesus, meek and humble of Heart, make my heart 
like Thine! 

When I am misunderstood and misrepresented, make 
me as calm, patient, resigned, and joyful as Thou wert, 
when Thyself, Thy divine mission, and Thy actions 
were misunderstood and grossly misrepresented. 

When I am falsely accused, make me as unruffled as 
Thou wert when Thy enemies accused Thee publicly of 
having a devil, of casting out devils by Beelzebub, and 
when Thou stoodst before Pilate, arraigned as a rebel 
plotting to take away the kingdom of Judea from the 
rule of Caesar. 

When I am spoken of contemptuously, when others 
are preferred before me, whether it be through injustice 
or by Thy permissive providence to cure me of my 
deep pride and morbid self-love, make me silent and 
resigned, as Thou wert when Barabbas, the murderer 
and the robber, was preferred before Thee, and when, 



478 Various Exercises for Holy Communion. 

hanging on the cross, the Jews cried out, "Vah! Thou 
that destroyest the Temple of God, and in three days 
dost rebuild it, save Thy own self: if Thou be the Son 
of God, come down from the cross" (Matt, xxvii. 40). 

In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes 
and ancients, mocking, said, "He saved others; Him 
self He can not save. If He be the King of Israel, 
let Him come down from the cross, and we will believe 
Him" (Matt, xxvii. 42). 

Make me act toward those who have offended me as 
Thou didst to Magdalen, whom Thou didst love most 
of others after Thy Mother; as Thou didst to Peter, whom 
Thou didst not only fully forgive, but didst make him 
prince of the apostles. 

These are some of the weak parts of my moral nature, 
and I beseech Thee to invigorate and strengthen them. 

These are the points where my resolutions so often 
fail, and the enemy too frequently triumphs. 

Give me such fortitude that I may never be defeated 
again. 

Leave the impress of Thy example on my soul to-day, 
that it may stimulate me to walk in Thy footsteps, and 
so become like Thee in my thoughts, words, and actions, 
but especially in my conduct toward others. 

Oh! dear Jesus, I desire most earnestly to be Thy 
real disciple, Thy true and faithful follower. Help me 
with Thy grace. 

It is my resolve ever to try to learn the golden truth 
and to act upon it, that all real goodness must depend 
upon the practice of the love of God and my neighbor, 
as Our Saviour says: "On these two commandments 
dependeth the whole law and the prophets" (Matt, 
xxii. 40). 

It is my firm purpose to learn and practice humility, 
which consists in acting on the plain truth, that we have 
nothing of our own, and that whatever we possess be 
longs to God, according to the teaching of St. Paul: 



Various Exercises for Holy Communion. 479 

"By the grace of God, I am what I am" (i Cor. xv. 
10). . 

And if I am ever tempted to deny or to forget this 
primary truth, I will always say: "What hast thou that 
thou hast not received, and if thou hast received, why 
dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" (i Cor. 
iv. 7). 

And when self-love or others tempt me to glory in 
what is not mine, my answers shall be in the words of 
David: "Not to us, O Lord, but to Thy name, give 
glory" (Ps. cxiii. i). 

Neither will I put myself before others unfairly or 
unjustly, but will follow the advice of Our Saviour: "But 
when thou art invited, go sit down in the lowest place: 
that when he who inviteth thee cometh, he may say to 
thee, Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have 
glory before them that sit at table with thee" (Luke 
xiv. 10). 

And when pride and vanity are trying to enter my 
heart and mind, I will always remember my nothing 
ness and say: "Why is earth and ashes proud ? " (Ecclus. 
x. 9). 

If ever I have authority, or am in an honorable position, 
I will never treat those under me as my inferiors, but 
I will carry out the spirit of Our Saviour s instructions, 
where He says: "W T hoever shall be the greater among 
you, let him be your minister, and he that shall be first 
among you shall be your servant" (Matt. xx. 26, 27). 

Thus I shall avoid the punishment of the proud, 
and receive the reward of the humble: "And whoso 
ever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and he that 
humbleth himself shall be exalted" (Matt, xxiii. 12). 

I am determined to be fully resigned. to God s will, 
and in all that happens to say from my heart in every 
sorrow and misfortune, "Not my will, but Thine, be 
done" (Luke xxii. 42). 

I promise to leave myself and my future with child-

like trust and confidence in God s hands, and to banish 
all fear, anxiety, and restlessness about what may happen. 

I firmly resolve, with God s grace, never wilfully to 
commit any venial sin, whether of pride, vanity, anger, 
jealousy, revenge, uncharitableness, or untruthfulness, 
and if I fail, I am determined at once to ask God s for 
giveness by an act of sorrow. 

It is my unshaken intention to correspond with the 
inspirations of grace; and never to forget the injunction 
of St. Paul: "And we exhort you not to receive the 
grace of God in vain" (2 Cor. vi. i). 

This is the way to lead good lives, to prepare for a 
happy death, and to save our souls. Then we shall be 
so pleasing to God that He will guard us as the apple 
of His eye, and protect us under the shadow of His 
wings, and whenever we die a crown of eternal glory 
will await us, for "He that shall persevere unto the end, 
he shall be saved" (Matt. x. 22).

A SPECIAL REQUEST. 

B BAREST Lord, whilst Thou art with me I have 
one great favor to ask, which I am sure Thou 
wilt grant, because it is for Thy greater glory and for 
my good. 

From to-day, and for the rest of my life, I want to 
love Thee with an unselfish, perfect love. 

I do not want to love Thee only for what gifts or 
rewards I shall receive, or for the punishments I shall 
avoid. 

I do not desire to love Thee merely because I shall 
thereby obtain heaven and avoid hell. 

But I ardently wish to love Thee for Thine own dear 
sake, because Thou art so infinitely good, beautiful, 
powerful, rich, tender, compassionate, and loving. 

Because there is no king or emperor can compare with 
Thee, and imagination can not conceive any being that 
can dimly approach Thee. 

This, loving Jesus, is the request I now make with al/ 
the fervor of my soul.

A PRAYER TO BECOME A FERVENT RELIGIOUS. 

N calling me to the religious life, O God of my 
heart! Thou hast called me to perfection; Thou 
wishest that I should daily aspire to it, and Thou afford- 
est me the most abundant means for that purpose. But, 
alas! how remote am I from that solid and perfect 
virtue which should characterize Thy faithful spouse! 
What a long journey still remains for me to arrive at 
that happy term! Notwithstanding the many years I 
have passed in religion, I find myself still subject to 
the same defects, and I make no progress in virtue. 
Instead of advancing, I very often fall back; instead 
of correcting myself, of becoming more holy, of being 
more faithful to my duties, of being more detached 
from the world and myself, more mild and charitable, 
more exact and fervent, more docile, submissive, more 
poor in spirit and heart, I continue to be tepid and negli 
gent ; averse to trouble and contradiction ; hostile to mor 
tification, silence, and recollection; seeking in all things 
my satisfaction, the gratification of my humor and 
natural inclinations. O my God! shall I be always 
an unfaithful soul, an imperfect Religious, a spouse 
unworthy of Thee? How great a misfortune for me, 
were death to take me by surprise! Vouchsafe, O 
Spouse of my soul! to lend me Thy all-powerful hand; 
draw me from my tepidity, inspire me with a holy zeal 
for my perfection; and, in order to repair the lost time, 
conduct me by rapid steps to the term of my vocation.

MARKS OF A FERVENT RELIGIOUS.* 

E perfection of a Religious does not consist, as is some- 
times imagined, in undertaking great things, in reciting 
long prayers, or in sublime contemplation, in practicing 
excessive austerities and mortifications, in performing heroic 
acts of virtue; in a word, it does not consist in walking in 
an extraordinary way and distinguishing one s self by a 
singular mode of life, or by making one s self prominent 
before the world. We are to seek perfection only in the 
faithful keeping of our vows and in the strict observance 
of our rules and constitutions. The following points are to 
be remarked in the conduct of a fervent Religious: 

1. In regard to God the fervent Religious punctually 
performs all his exercises of piety in accordance with the 
spirit of God and of his holy Institute. Or, to enter more 
into details, he recites all his vocal prayers with attention, 
makes his meditations with fervor and his spiritual reading 
considerately, receives holy communion with due prepara 
tion, and performs all his actions with a pure intention, 
solely to please and serve God, with inviolable fidelity to 
grace, with perfect conformity to the divine will, with the 
most intimate union of his heart with the Sacred Heart of 
Jesus Christ, Who deigned to call him to so holy and exalted 
a state. 

2. In regard to his neighbor he is full of respect and 
esteem in accordance with the divine law and his own con 
science; he is charitable and obliging, meek, patient, and 
indulgent toward others; bears their ill-humor vith com 
posure, excuses their faults, sympathizes with them in their 
sufferings and trials, forestalls their desires and wishes, most 
carefully shuns all cutting remarks, bitter complaints, un 
pleasant retorts, all kinds of dissatisfaction, all coldness and 
unfeelingness. He seeks occasions to oblige them, to render 
them service, and this without exacting gratitude in return. 
. 

* By Rev. Jos. Schneider, S.j. 



486 Various Exercises for Holy Communion. 

He is never more pleased than when he can befriend them. 
He gives to all a good example, helps and consoles them, 
and does all he can to contribute to the happiness of those 
with whom he lives. 

3. In regard to himself he is all humility, retirement, and 
watchfulness. In him reigns a constant equanimity with 
a cheerful peace of mind. He is always perfectly composed 
and devoid of obstinacy, uneasiness, confusion, pride, and 
arrogance. Without hypocrisy or duplicity he considers 
himself as the servant of all, and sees in his neighbor Jesus 
Christ Himself. He neither seeks human applause, nor 
yields to the cravings of vanity, self-love, and self-compla 
cency, and cheerfully devotes himself to promoting the glory 
of God in whatever place, employment, or rank, obedience 
and divine Providence may place him. 

In short, a fervent Religious shows in his whole conduct 
and in his actions nothing singular or extraordinary, but 
he imparts a sublime elevation and value to all his actions 
and to his whole conduct by his exalted motives, by the 
wholly divine exercise of an interior and recollected life, 
of walking in the presence of God, of desire for perfection, 
and by his consideration and expectation of heavenly bliss. 
Thus have many Religious lived, e.g., a St. Aloysius Gon- 
zaga, in whose life there was seen nothing grand or extraor 
dinary, and who, by the exercises of an apparently ordinary 
life, raised himself to a very high degree of holiness. St. 
Mary Magdalen de Pazzi once beheld him in a vision clothed 
with brightest glory, at which sight she was so full of astonish 
ment and wonder that she fell into an ecstasy. How did 
St. Aloysius reach such a height of virtue and glory? By 
constant fidelity to grace, by the faithful performance of all 
his duties, by his "inner and hidden life," so full of treasures 
of merits, so unknown to the world, but so pleasing to God 
and richly rewarded by Him. 

This grand model urges us to lead, a perfect life, and cor 
rects our many former errors concerning piety. It is very 
consoling to timorous souls, who do not feel strong enough 
to take a lofty flight like the eagle, but who can gather there 
from the hope of attaining, even step by step, that degree 
of perfection to which they are called by their state and the 
grace of God.

Let us also keep in view this exalted model, that he may 
serve us as a mirror wherein to contemplate how we may

THE MARKS BY WHICH IT MAY BE KNOWN WHETHER 
HE. WILL BECOME A GOOD AND FAITHFUL MEMBER OF 
HIS ORDER.* 

PERFECT novice, who in time will become a true 
Religious, may be known by the following signs: 

1. He never commits a venial sin with full deliberation. 

2. He conceals nothing from his Superiors, nor does he 
wish that they should remain in ignorance of anything about 
him whatever. 

3. He bears it without bitterness if his faults are shown 
to him. 

4. He cheerfully does penance for failings which scarcely 
deserve a punishment. 

5. He takes advantage of every chance to deny and mortify 
himself. 

6. He always speaks of matters that are in keeping with 
his vocation. 

7. He keeps so close a guard over his external conduct 
that a searching eye finds hardly anything to blame. 

8. Books that excite virtuous resolutions he reads with 
greater fervor and relish than those which merely satisfy 
curiosity and engage the mind. 

9. He entertains no special friendship that rests on purely 
natural grounds. 

10. He steadily combats self-love by undertaking, with 
the consent of his Superiors, whatever he dislikes. 

11. He struggles with success against weariness at prayer, 
reading, and other spiritual exercises. 

12. He estimates the practical value of meditation, not 
by the consolation he experiences, but by the amount of love 
he acquires for virtue and the care he takes to avoid wilful 
imperfections. 

* According to P. Dirkink, S.J. 



488 Various Exercises for Holy Communion. 

13. He longs for perfection, not to benefit self, but to 
please God. 

14. He avoids the smallest violation against the Rule and 
holds nothing unimportant that bears on perfection. 

15. He frequently consults his novice-master and submits 
to his guidance to the intent: 

(a) That he may be protected against the danger of mortally 
offending God, and lessen the number of venial sins and 
imperfections. 

(b) That he may practice virtue with safety. 

(c) That he may learn to perform his interior and exterior 
actions more perfectly from day to day. 

16. Of several good works he aims to choose the more 
perfect. 

17. He shows no preference for any occupation, office, or 
place, but simply accommodates himself to every situation 
and circumstance. 

18. He is always satisfied and cheerful, never ill-humored 
or self-willed. 

19. He is not easily worried about anything, and construes 
matters in the best light; but things that may injure the 
community, a wrong-doer, or a neighbor, he does not fail 
to report. 

20. A novice fashioned in this mould and rooted in solid 
virtue, leaves the novitiate with such a dread of sin and imper- 
Jection, and such a love of virtue and perfection, that all 
alone and without fear of reproof he will lead a life as vir 
tuous, pure, and guarded as if he were constantly under the 
observing eye of a most venerated Superior. 

I conclude with the short advice, " Do this and thou shalt 
live." Yes, you will live in your Community with pleasure, 
your life will be blameless, godly, and perfect, as becomes 
a true follower of Christ. I entreat you, only make a brave 
start; for "well begun is half done." "When you begin," 
ays St. Bernard, "begin well; if you do, you will soon 
reach the end." And when, like the angels ascending, you 
have mounted, as up a Jacob s ladder, the rounds of virtue, 
you will find the Lord leaning upon the topmost round, and 
you will be clasped in the blessed, outstretched arms of God.

BEFORE COMMUNION. 

/. Who comes ? 

E, Who is King of kings, and Lord of lords" (Apoc. 
xix.) ; "the King of glory" (Ps. xxiii.) ; "a power 
ful King and greatly to be feared, Who sitteth upon His 
throne and is the God of dominion" (Ecclus. i.); He of 
Whom it is written: " On His head were many diadems" 
(Apoc. xix.); "Thousands of thousands ministered to 
Him, and ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood 
before Him" (Dan. vii.); "And the armies that are 
in heaven followed Him " (Apoc. xix.); " And the four- 
and-twenty ancients fell down before Him and adored 
Him and cast their crowns before the throne " (Apoc. 
iv.). 

"Aftei wards He was seen upon earth, and conversed 
with men" (Baruch iii.). 

"Art Thou a King then? ... I am a King. For 
this was I born and for this came I into the world" (John 
xviii.); "I am appointed King over Sion" (Ps. ii.). 

Yet how little He parades His royalty. Among the 
things that are so sweet in the character of Our King, is 
the absence of condescension about Him. He says so 
little about Himself. He comes so silently into our 
midst. He drops so quietly into our ways that we 
have to be continually reminding ourselves Who He is. 
Kings never succeed in putting those around them quite 
at their ease. They betray themselves unconsciously by 
the attentions they exact. "Do you forget," said one, 

* By Mother Mary Loyola. 



490 Before and after Communion. 

"that I am your king?" With the King of kings it is 
not so. He does not show us that He is stooping to 
come among us, that He feels our companionship try 
ing after what He has been used to, that our ways and 
our rudeness jar on His infinite refinement. No, He 
leaves St. Paul to speak about the annihilation of His 
Incarnation: "Taking the form of a servant, being 
made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a 
man" (Phil. ii.). He Himself seems to be, if we might 
venture to say so, proud of what He gained by His com 
ing. He loves to call Himself the Son of man. And 
once among us, He tries to be like us as far as He can. 
What we have to do and bear, He will do and bear, and 
as we take our daily privations and troubles as a matter 
of course, so will He. He speaks so seldom of Who He 
is, that some have said, He has never told us plainly 
that He is God. If He works miracles all day long 
during the three years of the public ministry, it is for 
our sakes, and He only speaks of them when our good 
requires that He should speak. Of His frightful suffer 
ings He scarcely makes any mention two or three 
times, that is all and so calmly, quite as a thing to 
be looked for. When they were over, He said they 
were only what we ought to have expected our Messias 
to do for us. Ought not Christ to have suffered these 
things? "These things" (Luke xxiv.), as if the mock 
ing, and the scourging, and the crucifixion, which had 
completely staggered the faith of His disciples, were 
nothing so very wonderful after all. 

" Cur igitur non amem Te 
O Jesu amantissime! " 

O dearest King, who will give me a single reason 
in the wide world why I should not love You, why I 
should not dedicate to You every fiber of my being, 
why I should not strive with all my heart and soul and 
mind and strength to return You love for love? 



Before and after Communion. 491 

Faith. 

" T T is a great glory to follow the Lord." I know it, O 
*&amp;gt; Lord, I know it. And I know how utterly unworthy 
I am to be ranked among Your followers, Your per 
sonal attendants, Your friends. I can not understand 
in the very least how You can have chosen me. But 
I make my act of faith, without understanding, and 
so come to Your feet, that by union with You I may 
become a little less unworthy. 

Love. 

OU also wast with Jesus of Nazareth" (Matt. 

xxvi.). My King and my Leader, put into my 
heart so strong a love of You, that I may be eager to 
follow You everywhere, even to pain and shame. Let 
the reproach which was flung at Peter be my glory. 
Let my highest ambition here, let my happiness here 
after be, "Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth." 

II. To whom does He come ? 

*T* SEE the King standing on a grassy plain near Jeru- 
" salem, surrounded by those who believe in Him 
and love Him. He is fair and beautiful, and the hearts 
of His servants go out to Him as He stands there in 
their midst, on the green grass with the wild flowers 
at His feet. I see Him calling a certain number, a 
few to be His personal followers, His intimate com 
panions, His friends. He chooses them here and there; 
He calls them by their names one by one. Shall I 
say to my infinite surprise shall I say to my extreme 
confusion shall I say to my intense joy, I hear my 
own name called? 

I see these so called stepping forth from the ranks 
and forming a little inner circle round Him His per 
sonal companions, His friends. "I will not now call 
you servants, but friends" (John xv.). Such a call is 
His free gift. He is Master of His gifts and He dis 
penses them as He chooses. He binds all men by the

law of His commandments. He invites a few to the 
following of His counsels / am oj that few. Some 
souls He designs for great gifts, others for greater, others 
again for greatest / am elected to the greatest. 

Well may I cast down my eyes; well may I thank 
Him that He does not go by goodness or by fitness, but 
by His own glorious freedom of choice. 

OGIFT of gifts, O gracious call, 
My God, how can it be, 
That Thou Who hast discerning love 
Shouldst give that gift to me I 

How many hearts Thou might st have had 

More innocent than mine, 
How many souls more worthy far

I lovingly adore; 
O give me grace to keep Thy grace 

And grace to merit more. 

QUID RETRIBUAM? \Vhat shall I give Him? 
Surely that for which He is looking the corre 
spondence befitting such a vocation. By my profession I. 
am called to the special praise, reverence, and service of 
God. I must see that He gets this from me. Like a 
courtier living in the palace, always in the immediate 
presence of royalty, there must be in my praise, rever 
ence, and service, a delicacy, an assiduity, an exactitude, 
a generosity not called for from those outside. Mine 
is a service more nearly observed and to be more glori 
ously requited. 

God looks to Religious as to those with whom He 



Before and after Communion. 493 

may solace Himself. Repelled by the generality of 
men, He turns to them to open Himself to them. 
Therefore no minimizing for me, no paring down of a 
service, which when I have done my best, He must use 
all His condescension to accept. 

But there are degrees of devotedness even in the corps 
d elite. There are those who are content to fulfil their 
engagements, to do their own work, to keep in view 
the movements of their own division. But as to the 
whole army, to the general interests, to following the 
King closely this has no attraction for them they 
are not eminent. 

And there are those whose one desire is to follow 
their King as closely as possible. Where the battle is 
thickest where the blows are hardest where the 
marches are longest and the burdens heaviest there 
they will be because He is there. Mortifications that 
are not necessary, pain, and injuries, and ignominy are 
their choice because they were His. 

"Always to do my very best for Him all that I can 
possibly do I will do for Him." This is the cry of 
their hearts. It shall be my cry. He is a King to live 
for a King to die for a King to Whom it should be a 
joy to sacrifice personal interest, convenience, com 
fort, health, strength, time, talents, life itself. 

Let me do all that lies in me, to make my Congre 
gation a stronghold in His cause. This it will be if 
His principles reign supreme, if His service is the thought 
paramount in every heart not those around me, cer 
tainly not me, for the first and foremost consideration, 
but everywhere and always the King His interests, 
His glory, His greater service.

Of this life s mortal span, 
Except to glorify the God 
Who for our sakes was man?"

My own heart first. Yes, for all strong, lasting influ 
ence for good must spring from the interior spirit. It 
must come of personal devotion to you, of close union 
with Your Sacred Heart. That Heart must win me 
to detachment from comforts and convenience, to detach 
ment from honor and reputation, to detachment from 
self in all its forms if I am to follow my Lord closely, 
and win souls for Him. 

I see Him holding out His hands and saying to me: 
Will you come? Asking for help, asking for personal 
service, personal devotedness, personal sacrifice such 
as He has given to me. Will you come? Will you be 
content with My food, with My cup, with My clothing, 
content to share My labors and privations, content this 
coming year with My food the will of My Father, with 
My cup suffering, with My livery, humiliations and

shalt be, my Lord King, either in death or in life, there 
will Thy servant be" (2 Kings). 

Humility. 

OW St. Francis Borgia prized his vocation ! Per- 
haps the humility and gratitude of that humble 
heart may find its way into mine, if I use his words 
and ask to feel as he felt: 

"O my Lord, in Whom alone I put my trust, what 
is there in me that Thou shouldst look upon me ? What 
hast Thou found in me, that Thou shouldst call me to 



Before and after Communion. 495 

form one of the company of Thy chosen servants! For 
they ought to be valiant, and I am a coward; they 
ought to be despisers of the world, and I am a slave 
to its opinion; they ought to be haters of themselves, 
and I am full of self-love. What then didst Thou find 
in me? Perhaps Thou didst perceive me to be bolder 
than others in disobeying Thy commands, more indiffer 
ent to Thy glory, more wedded to my own interests. 
Surely, if Thou didst seek these things, Thou didst 
find them in me." 

" Thy choice, O God of goodness! then 

I lovingly adore, 

Oh, give me grace to keep Thy grace, 
And grace to merit more." 

Contrition. 

IN return for all Your favor, my God, You do not 
ask much, but You do ask for faithfulness. And 
I have been so unfaithful. There has been so little 
alacrity in Your service, so much self-seeking, so many 
shortcomings every way. 

Yet I know You will not have me to be discouraged. 
I know You are ready to take us up at any time. For 
give me all there is to forgive You know, my God, 
what that means. Could I ask it of any other than You ? 

III. Why does He come? 

comes to fire my heart with the loyal love of 
Him, with the devotion to His person, on which 
the fervor of my service depends. He comes to be 
near me, to put Himself within my reach, to unite Him 
self intimately to me, that so I may be able to appre 
ciate His character, to learn His ways, to know Him. 
Not to know Him is darkness and death. To know 
Him is light and life eternal. "This is eternal life, to 
know Thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ, Whom 
Thou hast sent" (John xvii.). He is the Model on the 



496 Before and after Communion. 

Mount, upon which all the elect are to be formed. The 
knowledge of Him is the condition in the order of God s 
providence for carrying out His mission in the world. 

What God required in the apostles was not that they 
should be learned men or able men, but that they 
should know His Son. St. Peter, too, required it when 
he proposed another to fill the place of Judas. "Of 
these men who have companied with us, all the time 
that the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst 
us, . . . one of these must be made a witness with us" 
(Acts i.). The same personal knowledge was given 
to St. Paul, revealed to him by Our Lord Himself. 
The same is required in all those who by their voca 
tion are chosen to carry on the work of Jesus Christ. 
It is the condition necessary to success. It is the train 
ing the soldiers must go through before they can be 
let loose upon the enemy. An instrument, to be efficient, 
must be united to the main agent; we must be united 
to Our Lord, we must study Him, we must be like Him 
in His character, in His ways, in His likings and dis- 
likings, in His methods, in His principles, if we are to 
influence others as He did. He drew all to Him, that 
He might draw all to God. We must draw all to God 
by giving them Jesus Christ. 

Personal devotion to Him, familiarity with Him, is 
then an obligation for us. It must be the fruit of study 
and of prayer. We say of those whom we love, and 
with whom we are familiarly acquainted, "He would 
say this, he would act in this way, this reminds me of 
him, this is like him." So must we come to know 
Christ our Lord, that we may conform ourselves to 
Him and bring out His characteristics, some in one 
way, some in another. This is the secret of finding an 
easy way into the hearts of all. Those who have this 
strong, personal devotion to Our Lord, have a tact, an 
address, a facility of approach denied to others. For 
those who know Him best love Him most, and are 



JSefore and after Communion. 497 

most blessed by Him. They are most near Him and 
like Him here, and are to be most near Him and like 
Him by-and-by. 

This personal devotion to Our Lord is the one thing 
needed by many souls to make them all that God wants, 
and all that they require to be most useful in His service. 

If this be true, O Lord, and I know that it is true, 
then it is plain why You are coming to me. I shall 
have much to talk to You about, much to ask, and 
much to obtain from Your Heart. 

Hope and Desire.

Love. 

not, for I have redeemed thee and called 
thee by thy name: thou art Mine" (Is. xliii.). 
Yes, I am Yours, my God, Yours wholly, Yours only. 
I know that if it depended on Your will alone, my per 
severance and salvation would be assured. But there 
is my own treacherous, inconstant will, ever ready to 
play me false. On what rock can I anchor it, what 
is there that will secure it against its own instability? 
One thing only, a strong personal love of Him Whom 
You have given me for my Redeemer and Saviour. 

Of all motives a personal love of Jesus is the strongest 
and lasts the longest. Others lose their force. The 
Jove of God in a vague sort of a way will not stand the 
test of time and trial ; temptation comes, and those who 
have relied on it fall away. But those who cling to Our 
Lord with a deep, personal love remain steadfast to the 
end. 

That this love may be possible, I must believe firmly 
in His personal love of me. I am not to say, "Of 
course Our Lord can love this one or that, but I can 
not see what He can find to love in me." My seeing 
has nothing to do with it. I am to believe it heartily, 
like all other mysteries. He does love me and He wants 
my love. 

Nor must I say, "My heart is cold and hard. He 
can not care for love such as mine." Our Lord wants 
my love, such as it is, such as I can give Him. No 
two hearts give Him the same kind of love. He does 
not ask me to give Him any one else s love, but my own. 



500 Before and after Communion. 

He wants of each what each can give. And so He asks 
of me a love which only my heart can give, a love which 
if I refuse Him He will never have. 

O Lord and Master, how can I refuse what is Yours 
by every conceivable claim? How can I help bringing 
to You with joy the little I have to give? Take, O 
Lord, take all. 

O Sovereign and true Leader, O Christ my King, 
I kneel before You here like a vassal in the old feudal 
times to take my oath of fealty. I place my joined 
hands within the wounded hands and renew the dear 
vows of my Profession. And I bring up to You all 
that depend on me to show You homage and allegiance. 
All the powers of my soul, all the senses of my body, 
all the affections of rny heart I offer them all to You. 

Sume et suscipe Take, take all, O Lord! 

O ye angels, archangels, thrones and dominations, 
principalities and powers, virtues of heaven, cherubim 
and seraphim, adore Our God for me; thank Him, and 
love Him with me. Patriarchs and prophets, apostles, 
all ye martyrs of Christ, holy confessors, virgins of the 
Lord, and all ye saints, adore Him, thank Him, love 
Him with me. 

Mother of God, adore your Son for me, thank Him, 
and love Him for me. 

O Heart of Jesus, be my adoration and my thanks 
giving to the three divine persons now dwelling within 
me. 

Eternal Father, look upon the face of Your Christ. 
Through Him and with Him and in Him be to You 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory. 
Amen.

think of You as my inward Witness. It is a joy to 
know that "Thou hast understood my thoughts" (Ps. 
cxxxviii.j, that there is nothing I can hide from You, 
even if I would. Bad as I am, I am content that You 
know all. I have no secrets from You, my God. 

And so I lay my heart here at Your feet, and open 
it out before You. All its needs, all its miseries, all its 
longings are known to You what it is, what it ought 
to be, what You want it to be. Take it into Your hands. 
Put it right for me. You can, and You have the will. 
You are its Maker; You know exactly what is wrong. 
What springs to touch You know, and what to cleanse, 
and what to renew. 

" For Thou hast made this wondrous soul 

All for Thyself alone; 
Ah! send Thy sweet transforming grace 
To make it more Thine own." 

Your interest and Your intentions are mine, my 
God, because they are Yours. I love and care for them 
all, I pray for them every one. The interests of Your 
greater glory; the accomplishment of Your will; the 
extension of Your kingdom for all this I pray. For 
the Church suffering, the holy, waiting souls; for the 
Church militant, and her almost infinite needs; for 
the Holy See above all. I think of the weight of solici 
tude that day and night presses on the anxious head 
of the Vicar of Christ, . . . and I pray for him. I pray 
for all rulers in Church and State ; for all who can much 
advance or hinder the good of souls. I pray for all 
laborers in Your vineyard, for all who are now bearing 
the burden and heat of the day. And I beg for all Your 
pity, Your blessing, and Your help.

into a large place, He delivered me because I pleased 
Him." (2 Kings xxii.) 

"Therefore will I give thanks to Thee, O Lord, and 
will sing to Thy name." (2 Kings xxii.) 

My God, keep ever fresh in my heart the thanks 
giving with which it gave itself to You on the day You 
called me from the world into Religion, on the day 
You clothed me with Your livery, on the day You re 
ceived my vows. As long as that thanksgiving is there, 
my vocation is safe. At least I was in earnest then. 
At my Profession I chose You, I forsook all things for 
You. It was not much, but like Peter I could say 
it was all things; it was all I had, and if it had been a 
thousand times more I would gladly have left it to follow 
You, O Lord. All I had I gave You body and soul, 
and mind, and heart, and will, that I might be all Yours 
and live only for You and for Your service. Has there 
been rapine in the holocaust? Have I broken my 
faith with You, my God? Oh, give me grace to be 
always what I was then, in my desires, in self-surrender, 
in the sincerity of my oblation. "Confirm, O Lord, 
what Thou hast wrought in us" (Ps. Ixvii.). "Renew 
our days as from the beginning " (Lament, v.). 

God, Who called me then and gave me grace to 
begin, give me now more abundant grace to perfect 
my offering and make my election sure. 

1 commend to You aft whom You have loved with 
me and sought out and gathered together with me into 
the same religious family, all who are under the same 
roof with me. You have Your designs on all and on 
each. I offer them each and all to You. Because of 
their merits, because of their company, in which I hope 
to be found at my death, have mercy on me. You 
have numbered me with Your chosen ones in this life, 
number me with them in the life to come. Say to me 
at judgment: "Thou art one of them" (Mark xiv.).

Let it be said to each of our Superiors as to St. Paul: 
" God hath given thee all them that sail with thee. . . .

Oblation. 

/T\Y God, what can I give to You in return for all 
^"* You have given to me? I give You my heart, 
I give You my love, I give You my body with all its 
senses, my soul with all its powers, my heart with all 
its affections. I give You my vows. I give You all 
I have and am, now and always in time and eternity. 
I bring to You all I love, all my treasures, all who are 
dear to me, all who are in any way entrusted to me, 
and I give them all into Your keeping. 

I trust to You my temptations, my graces, my respon 
sibilities, my opportunities. I trust to You my progress 
in the way of perfection, my desire of a closer, more 
uninterrupted union with You. Bring me up to the 
ideal You had in Your divine mind when You created 
my soul. I could not bear, my God, to fall short of 
Your designs after all You have done for me; I could 
not bear to be a disappointment to You throughout 
eternity. 

" Jesu, quern velatum nunc aspicio, 
Oro, fiat illud, quod tarn sitio, 
Ut, Te revelata cernens facie, 
Visu sim beatus Tuae gloriae." 

" O Jesu, Whom by faith I now descry, 

Shrouded from mortal eye, 
When wilt Thou slake the thirsting of my heart 

To see Thee as Thou art, 
Face unto face in all Thy glad array, 

Tranced with the glory of that everlasting day?"

CONTRITION, HOPE, CONFIDENCE, DESIRE. 

f\ JESUS, most sweet and loving Spouse of my 
soul, behold, the longed-for moment draws near: 
the rapturous moment, in which I, Thy unworthy 
creature, shall receive the Most Holy Sacrament of 
Thy body and blood, as the most effectual remedy for 
all my miseries. For the love of Thee I grieve most 
bitterly for every one of my sins and my negligences, 
whereby I have offended Thy tender goodness, and 
defiled my soul, which Thou didst ransom with Thine 
own most precious blood. How shall I presume to 
receive Thee into a heart all set around with briars 
and thorns, reeking with foul and unwholesome vapors 
of worldliness and vain desires! But, my merciful 
Jesus, though I am sick of soul, I remember the words 
which fell from Thine own gracious lips that they who 
are whole need not the physician, but they who are sick 
and this gives me confidence. Good Jesus, Who didst 
invite the blind and the lame, the poor and the needy, to 
Thy supper, behold, as one of them, yea, even as the 
poorest and most wretched of them all, I will draw 
near to the most sacred feast of Thy body and blood, 
the Banquet of the angels, not in presumption, but with 
a contrite and humble heart, with lowly confidence, 
with hope in Thy goodness and mercy, with love for 
all the love that Thou hast shown to me, with vehement 
desire to please Thee, to be all Thine, and to live hence 
forth for Thee alone.

TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. 

Prayer of St. Gertrude before communion, the efficacy 
of which Our Lord revealed to her. 

OMOST loving Lord Jesus Christ, I beseech Thee, 
by all the love of Thy sweetest Heart, that Thou 
wouldst vouchsafe to offer for me all that perfection 
wherewith Thou didst stand arrayed in the presence 
of God the Father when Thou didst ascend on high 
to enter into Thy glory; and through Thy sinless and 
unspotted manhood to render my polluted soul pure 
and free from every sin, vnd through Thy most glorious 
divinity to endow and a lorn it with every virtue, and 
through the virtue of that love, which has forever united 
Thy supreme divinity to Thine immaculate humanity, 
to furnish it befittingly with Thy best gifts. Amen. 

TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY. 

Prayer, which the Blessed Virgin herself taught St. 
Gertrudt. 

OMOST chaste Virgin Mary, T beseech thee by that 
unspotted purity wherewith thou didst prepare 
for the Son of God a dwelling of delights in thy virginal 
womb, that by thy intercession I may be cleansed from 
every stain. 

O most humble Virgin Mary, I beseech thee by that 
most profound humility whereby thou didst merit to 
be raised high above all the choirs of angels and of saints, 
that by thy intercession all my negligences may be 
expiated. 

O most amiable Virgin Mary I beseech thee, by that 
ineffable love which united thee so closely and so in 
separably to God, that by thy intercession I may obtain 
an abundance of all merits. Amen.

Q JESUS, surpassingly sweet, Who hast said with 
Thine own gracious lips that Thy delights are to 
be with the children of men, my soul longeth for Thee, 
my heart yearneth now toward Thee. Wherefore I 
invite Thee to come unto me with all that devotion and 
that love wherewith any loving soul hath ever invited 
Thee to itself. Come, then, O most beloved Spouse of 
my ^soul; come, my only love; come and turn aside 
awhile into the poor and wretched hovel of my heart. 
Come, Thou heavenly Physician, come and heal my 
stricken soul. Come, O Friend, a thousandfold above 
all others beloved, come and enrich my utter poverty. 

Come, Thou bright and genial Sun, and scatter the 
thick darkness which hangs upon my heart. Come, 
Thou sweetest Manna, and satisfy my soul s exceed 
ing hunger. Come, O Jesus, incomparable in Thy 
loveliness; come, Thou beloved of my heart s vows; 
come and sup with me in the chamber of my heart. 
And although I have made ready nothing that is worthy 
of Thy dazzling magnificence, yet wilt Thou find therein 
one dish of savory meat such as Thou lovest, a will 
which tends to Thee alone, and affections wholly Thine. 

O Thou my only Love, I long for Thy coming with 
most eager desire, I await Thy coming with yearning 
love. O Thou fairest of the sons of men, O spring 
of inexhaustible sweetness, O Thou sweeter than all 
sweetest delights, come, oh, come unto me, and disdain

of the only-begotten Son of God, Our Saviour Jesus 
Christ the very body which He took of the Virgin 
Mary in such a manner, that I may be truly incor

its members." 

May the prayer of the angelic doctor be fulfilled in 
me: "Most gracious God, grant that I may receive 
the Bread of angels, the King of kings, and Lord of lords 
with such contrition and devotion, such purity and 
faith, such good- will and intention, as may avail to 
the welfare and salvation of my soul. O most loving 
Father, grant that I may at last behold with open face 
and for evermore this same beloved Son of Thine, 
Whom I now purpose to receive in my pilgrimage, 
beneath the sacramental veils."

My eyes are dim in seeking Thee, my own; 
My flesh doth pine away for Thee, my own; 
My heart leaps up with joy to Thee, my own; 
My spirit faints receiving Thee, my own. 

Where in the height of heaven is light like Thee? 
Where in the breadth of heaven is bliss like Thee? 
Where in the depth of heaven is peace like Thee? 
Where in the home of love is love like Thee?

And waiting wait, O King and Spouse, for Thee, 
Till I am one forevermore with Thee. 

O sweetest Jesus, bring me home to Thee; 
Free me, O dearest God, from all but Thee, 
And all the chains that keep me back from Thee; 
Call me, O thrilling Love, I follow Thee; 
Thou art my All, and I love nought but Thee. 

O hidden Love, Who now art loving me;

most blessed Virgin on the day of Thy Incarnation, and

"JESUS, MY LORD." * 

J7ESUS, my Lord, fill my heart now with all the 
J virtues which ought to have been there to wel 
come Thee. Give me more faith and love, more hope 
and more contrition, more humility and patience and 
piety, a stronger will and a purer heart. I believe 
all that Thou hast in any way revealed to us; but, 
dearest Lord, make my faith more living, more loving, 
more vivid, more strong. I grieve for all my sins, 
offences, and negligences, from my first sin long ago 
down to the faults and shortcomings of yesterday and 
to-day. I grieve, too, over the dulness, coldness, and 
ingratitude of this heart which is now Thy tabernacle. 
I hope in Thee, O Lord, Who wilt never let me be con 
founded. I thank Thee for this supreme gift, and 
for all the gifts of Thy goodness, particularly for all 
the graces which, in spite of my miserable unworthiness, 
I have received in this Sacrament so often since the 
happy day of my first communion; and I beg of Thee, 
O Lord, the grace never more to abuse Thy graces. 

And now, adoring Thee in this deepest mystery of 
Thy condescension, and loving Thee above all in this 
Sacrament of Thy love, I lay all the wounds and wants 
of my soul before Thee, O my merciful and loving 
Redeemer! See the wretched plight to which I am 
reduced: faith so dull, hope so dim, love so cold. Look 
upon me, and pity me, and heal me, and I shall be 
healed. I ask Thy loving Heart, now so close to mine, 
for all that I need and desire. But I need only Thy 
self, O Lord; I desire none but Thee. I do not dare 
to ask for more grace, but I ask for more courage and

generosity in making use of all Thy graces. During 
all the hours that follow of this day, my thoughts, my 
words, and my deeds must be the thoughts and words 
and deeds that are fitting one on whom so many graces 
are showered hour by hour, the latest being this sacra 
mental communion. And so from day to day, from 
communion to communion, may I sanctify my soul 
and serve Thee, my almighty and all-merciful God, 
my Creator, my Redeemer, my Judge from day to 
day, and from communion to communion, on to the last 
communion which I hope to receive as my Viaticum. 
May that Viaticum conduct my soul, pure from sin, 
safe to the feet of my Jesus, Who has just now come 
to me as my Saviour, but then must be my Judge. O 
Jesus, my Saviour, be to me indeed a Saviour then 
and now and for ever. Amen.* 

Love. 

Thy excess of love, O divine Lord! Thou hast 
given Thyself to me. Tell me, O Jesus! what 
Thou desirest of me. Is there any sacrifice Thy love 
demands of me? Speak, Lord! for Thy child, Thy 
servant, listeneth, and, with Thy gracious assistance, 
will accomplish Thy divine pleasure. I love Thee, O 
my God! I love Thee, and love Thee alone: I love all 
Thy creatures for Thee and in Thee; ^and, with St. 
Paul, I will labor to become all to all, in order to gain 
all to Thee, O sweetest Jesus, O most amiable, most 
loving Lord Jesus. Strengthen me with Thy grace, 
hide me within Thine adorable Heart, and there let me 
live and die as a victim of Thy pure and perfect love. 

* The " Acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity before the Blessed 
Sacrament " (respectively by Father Ramiere, Father de la 
Colombiere, and Blessed Margaret Mary), which will be found 
among the prayers in honor of the Blessed Sacrament in the latter 
part of this book, may be appropriately recited here. Attention 
is also called to the Acts of Consecration and other prayers among 
the same devotions, many of which are most serviceable after holy 
communion.

OFFERINGS AND THANKSGIVINGS FROM THE PRAYERS OF 
ST. GERTRUDE. 

Offering to God the Father, of Exceeding Efficacy. 
MOST holy Father, behold I, Thy most unworthy 
servant, trusting only in Thine ineffable com 
passion, have received Thy beloved Son, Our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and even now hold Him in my heart as 
my own possession, most intimately united with me. 
Wherefore, receiving this Thy Son into my arms, even 
as did holy Simeon, I offer Him to Thee with all that 
love and that fulness of intention wherewith He offered 

* According to St. Francis de Sales. 



Exercise for Holy Communion. 513 

Himself to Thee for Thine everlasting glory, while 
lying in the manger, and when He was hanging upon 
the cross. Look, O compassionate Father, on this 
offering, which I, Thine unworthy servant, make to 
Thee, my living and true God, to Thine everlasting 
praise and glory, for Thine infinite rejoicing and delight. 

I offer to Thee the same, Thy Son, for myself, and for 
all those for whom I am accustomed or bound to pray, 
in thanksgiving for all the benefits Thou hast bestowed 
on us, and in supply of all those virtues and good works 
which, of our own mere negligence, we have failed to 
practice. I offer Him to Thee to obtain Thy grace 
and Thy mercy, that we may be preserved and delivered 
from all evil and sin, succored in every necessity of 
body or of soul, and brought forth through a happy 
death into everlasting joys. Finally, I offer Him to 
Thee for the remission of all my sins, and in satisfaction 
for that huge debt which I can not pay Thee, seeing that 
it far exceeds even ten thousand talents; and therefore, 
casting myself at Thy feet, O most merciful Father, I 
acknowledge and plead my utter poverty, in union 
with the bitterness of the Passion of Thy most sinless 
Son, in Whom Thou hast declared Thyself well pleased ; 
and in and through Him I make Thee full reparation 
and satisfaction for my sins, offering Thee all His sor 
rows, griefs, and tears, and all that expiation which He 
made upon the cross for the sins of the whole world. 

Remember also, O Lord, Thy servants who have 
gone before us with the sign of faith, and sleep the 
sleep of peace : for all and each of whom (and especially 
for N) I offer Thee that saving Victim Whom I have 
now received, the body and blood of Thy beloved Son; 
beseeching Thee, that through His infinite dignity and 
worth, and through the merits of all sainis, Thou wouldst 
grant them pardon of all their sins, and merciful 
release from all their pains. Amen. 



514 Exercise for Holy Communion. 

Offering to the Saints. 

You may form an idea of the efficacy of this offering from 
the vision vouchsafed to St. Gertrude when she had offered 
this Sacrament in honor of the holy angels; she saw these 
blessed spirits entranced with joy and gladness and overflow 
ing with abundant and thrilling delights, as though they had 
never known bliss before. 

MOST blessed Virgin Mary, behold, I most hum- 
bly and lovingly set before thee thy Son, Whom 
thou didst conceive in thy spotless womb, didst bring 
forth, and nourish at thy breasts, and press to thy heart 
with most tender and thrilling embraces; Him in Whose 
countenance Thou didst ever joy, and find ever fresh 
delights, and Who has this day given Himself to me 
in the ineffable condescension of His divine love. I 
offer Him to thee that thou mayest fold Him in thine 
arms, and kiss Him with the kisses of thy mouth, and 
love and worship Him for me and together with me, 
and offer Him, in deepest adoration, to the Most Holy 
Trinity for my sins and the sins of all the world; so 
that the prerogative of thy great dignity may obtain 
for me what I dare not presume to hope of myself. 

O all ye saints of God, and ye especially, my most 
beloved patrons, behold Jesus Christ, your Lord and 
Spouse, Whom while ye lived in the flesh ye loved with 
all your heart and all your strength; for in and through 
Him Whom I have now received in the Most Holy 
Sacrament, I salute you all and each of you, and offer 
Him to you for the signal increase of your joy, your glory, 
and your blessedness, with all the love and the faith 
fulness which He showed you in time, and now showeth 
you evermore in eternity, beseeching you all to worship 
and adore Him for me, and to offer Him to the Most 
Holy Trinity with all your consummate devotion on 
behalf of my necessities and those of the whole Church, 
and in thanksgiving for all the benefits He has ever

bestowed upon me. And whatever I am unable to obtain 
of myself, do you impetrate for me, through your merit- 
and intercessions. Amen. 

Thanksgiving of St. Gertrude. 

T my heart and my soul, together with all my 
senses, and all my powers of mind and body, 
give praise and thanks to Thee, O sweetest Jesus, in 
union with all the creatures of Thy hand, for the con 
descending mercy which Thou, O most faithful Lover 
of our salvation, hast deigned to show me, most un 
worthy, in this sacred banquet of Thy body and 
blood. Acknowledging my utter insufficiency, I offer 
unto Thee, O Most Blessed Trinity, all the praises and 
thanksgivings which the most sacred humanity of Our 
Lord Jesus Christ rendered Thee throughout His whole 
earthly life, and especially when He instituted this 
Sacrament. Receive also, O compassionate Father, 
all those thanksgivings which the Blessed Virgin Mary 
and all Thy saints have ever rendered Thee with ali 
their heart and all their soul, and especially when they 
have received this Sacrament; and mercifully grant 
that all my insufficiencies and my negligences may be 
supplied and satisfied for by their abundance and per 
fection. Amen.

and all my interior and exterior occupations, that they 
may be sanctified by Thee. Thy Divine Heart, O Jesus, 
shall possess all that I have and all that I am. In the

that I may never be separated from Thee. Amen. 

ACT OF CONSECRATION BY BLESSED MARGARET MARY 
ALACOQUE. 

*, N. N., give and consecrate to the Sacred Heart of 
Our Lord Jesus Christ my person and my life, 
my actions, penances, and sufferings, not wishing to 
make use of any part of my being for the future except 
in honoring, loving, and glorifying that sacred Heart. 

It is my irrevocable will to be entirely His, and to 
do everything for His love, renouncing with my whole 
heart- whatever might displease Him. 

I take Thee, then, O most sacred Heart, as the 
sole object of my love, as the protector of my life, as the 
pledge of my salvation, as the remedy of my frailty 
and inconstancy, as the repairer of all the defects of 
my life, and as my secure refuge in the hour of death. 

Be then, O Heart of goodness, my justification 
before God the Father, and remove far from me the 
thunderbolts of His just wrath. O Heart of love, I 
place my whole confidence in Thee. While I fear all 
things from my malice and frailty, I hope all things 
from Thy goodness. 

Consume, then, in me whatever can displease or be 
opposed to Thee, and may Thy pure love be so deeply 
impressed upon my heart that it may be impossible that 
I should ever be separated from Thee, or forget Thee. 

I implore Thee, by all Thy goodness, that my name 
may be written in Thee, for in Thee I wish to place all 
my happiness and all my glory, living and dying in 
very bondage to Thee. Amen.

of all who turn repentant to Thy Heart; and we return to Thee

that our salvation cost Thee Thy life, sacrificed upon the cross, 
and induced Thee to dwell continuously in the Blessed Sac 
rament, in order to be united with us as often as we desire. 
We, O Lord, to thank Thee for the great love Thou bearest us, 
promise with the help of Thy grace to receive Thee in the 
Blessed Sacrament as often as possible; to declare Thy praises 
in church and in every place, without human respect. O Lord,

Thee daily at the altar in accordance with Thy burning desire.

CONSECRATION OF THE FAMILY TO THE SACRED HEART. 



Heart of Jesus, Who didst manifest to Blessed 
Margaret Mary the desire of reigning in Christian families, 
we to-day wish to proclaim Thy most complete dominion over 
our own. We would live in future with Thy life, we would 
cause to flourish in our midst those virtues to which Thou hast 
promised peace here below, we would banish far from us the 
spirit of the world which Thou hast cursed: and Thou shall 
reign over our minds in the simplicity of our faith, and over 
our hearts by the whole-hearted love with which they shall 
burn for Thee, the flame of which we shall keep alive by the 
frequent reception of Thy Holy Eucharist. 

O divine Heart, deign to preside over our assemblings, to 
bless our enterprises, both spiritual and temporal, to dispel 
our cares, to sanctify our joys, to alleviate our sufferings. If 
ever one or other of us should have the misfortune to afflict 
Thee, remind him, O Heart of Jesus, that Thou art good and 
merciful to the penitent sinner. And when the hour of separa 
tion strikes, when death shall come to cast mourning into our 
midst, we will all, both those who go and those who stay, be 
submissive to Thy eternal decrees. We shall console ourselves 
with the thought that a day will come when the entire family, 
reunited in heaven, can sing for ever Thy glories and Thy 
mercies. 

May the immaculate heart of Mary and the glorious patriarch, 
St. Joseph, present this consecration to Thee, and keep it in our 
minds all the days of our life. All glory to the Heart of Jesus, 
our King and our Father. 

Plenary indulgence on the day of consecration, and every 
year on the day of renewal (on the usual conditions). Pius X, 
June 15, 1908.

PRAYER IN HONOR OF THE MOST HOLY NAME OF JESUS. 

OGOOD Jesus! O most tender Jesus! O most sweet Jesus! 
O Jesus, Son of Mary the Virgin, full of mercy and kind 
ness! O sweet Jesus, according to Thy great mercy, have pity 
on me! O most merciful Jesus, I entreat Thee by that precious 
blood of Thine which Thou didst will to pour forth for sinners, 
to wash away all my iniquities, and to look upon me, poor 
and unworthy as I am, asking humbly pardon of Thee, and 
invoking this holy name of Jesus. O name of Jesus, sweet 
name! Name of Jesus, name of joy! Name of Jesus, name 
of strength! Nay, what meaneth the name of Jesus but Saviour? 
Wherefore, O Jesus, by Thine own holy name, be to me Jesus, 
and save me. Suffer me not to be lost me, whom Thou didst 
create out of nothing. O good Jesus, let not my iniquity destroy 
what Thy almighty goodness made. O sweet Jesus, recognize 
what is Thine own, and wipe away from me what is not of 
Thee! O most kind Jesus, have pity on me while it is the time 
of pity, and condemn me not when it is the time of judgment.

PRAYER, DIVINE JESUS. 

JESUS, incarnate Son of God, Who for our salvation 
didst vouchsafe to be born in a stable, to pass Thy life 
in poverty, trials, and misery, and to die amid the sufferings 
of the cross, I entreat Thee, say to Thy divine Father at the 
hour of my death: Father, forgive him; say to Thy beloved 
mother: Behold thy Son; say to my soul: This day thou shall 
be with Me in paradise. My God, My God, forsake me not 
in that hour. I thirst; yes, my God, my soul thirsts after 
Thee, Who art the fountain of living waters. My life passes 
like a shadow; yet a little while, and all will be consummated. 
Wherefore, O my adorable Saviour! from this moment, for

PRAYER TO JESUS, LOVER OF CHILDREN. 

O JESUS, friend of children, Who from Thy most tender 
years didst grow visibly in wisdom and in grace before 
God and men; Who at the age of twelve wast seated in the 
Temple, in the midst of the Doctors, listening to them attentively, 
humbly asking them questions, and exciting their admiration 
by the prudence and wisdom of Thy discourse; Who didst 
receive so willingly the children, blessing them and saying 
to Thy disciples : Let them come to Me, for of such is the Kingdom 
of Heaven, inspire me as Thou didst inspire the Blessed Peter 
Canisius, model and guide of the perfect catechist, with a 
profound respect and a holy affection for childhood, a taste 
and a marked devotion for instructing them in Christian doc 
trine, a special aptitude in making them understand its mysteries 
and love its beauties. I ask this of Thee, through the inter 
cession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Amen.

PRAYER TO JESUS DEAD. 

O JESUS, Who in Thy bitter passion didst become the reproach 
of men and the man of sorrows, I venerate Thy sacred 
face, on which shone the grace and sweetness of the Divinity; 
now for my sake changed into the likeness of a leper. But 
under this deformity I perceive Thy infinite love, and I am 
overwhelmed with the desire of loving Thee and making Thee 
beloved by all men. The tears which stream from Thy eyes 
seem as precious pearls, which I love to gather up, in order to 
purchase with their infinite value the souls of poor sinners. 

O Jesus, Thy face is the only beauty which ravishes my 
heart. 1 am content not to see here below the sweetness of 
Thy look, not to feel the ineffable delight of a kiss of Thy 
mouth; but oh! I beseech Thee, print on me Thy divine 
likeness, and inflame me with Thy love, so that it may rapidly 
consume me, and I may soon come to see Thy glorious face 
in heaven. Amen.

Tu ad dexteram Dei sedes in 
gloria Patris. 

Judex crederis esse venturus. 

* Te ergo qucesumus, tuis fa 
mulis subveni, quos preti- 
oso sanguine redemisti. 



Thou art the everlasting Son 
of the Father. 

When Thou tookest upon 
Thee to deliver man, Thou 
didst not disdain the Vir 
gin s womb. 

Having overcome the sting of 
death, Thou didst open the 
kingdom of heaven to all 
believers. 

Thou sittest at the right hand 
of God, in the glory of the 
Father. 

We believe that Thou shalt 
come to be Our Judge. 

We therefore pray Thee to 
help Thy servants, whom 
Thou hast redeemed with 
Thy precious blood. 

Make them to be numbered 
with Thy saints in glory 
everlasting. 

Save Thy people, O Lord, 
and bless Thy inheritance. 

Govern them, and raise them 

up forever. 
Every day we bless Thee. 

And we praise Thy name 
for ever and ever. 

Vouchsafe, O Lord, this day, 

to keep us without sin. 
Have mercy on us, O Lord, 

have mercy on us. 
Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be 

upon us, as we have hoped 

in Thee; 
In Thee, O Lord, I have 

hoped; let me never be 

confounded. 

On occasions of solemn thanksgiving the following prayers are 
added : 



fac cum sanctis tuis 
in gloria numerari. 

Saivum fac populum tuum, 

Do mine, et benedic here- 

ditati tuae. 
Et rege eos, et extolle illos 

usque in aeternum. 
Per singulos dies, benedici- 

mus Te. 
Et laudamus nomen tuum in 

saeculum, et in saeculum 

saeculi. 
Dignare, Domine, die isto sine 

peccato nos custodire. 
Miserere nostri Domine, mise 

rere nostri. 
Fiat misericordia tua, Do 

mini, super nos: quemad- 

modum speravimus in Te. 
In Te, Domine speravi ; non 

confundar in aeternum.

REFLECTIONS ON BENEDICTION. 

ELIGIOUS, in particular, ought to be grateful 
for the many opportunities they have of assisting 



542 Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. 

at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and they 
ought to show this gratitude by the fervor of their devo 
tion, and by ever seeking to make this expression of 
their love of Jesus in the Holy Eucharist and this tribute 
of their praise and adoration as splendid as the circum 
stances will permit. Jesus must be pleased with this 
devotion. As though it were too long for His burning 
love to remain hidden all day in the tabernacle, He 
permits His priests to take Him out at evening and 
place Him aloft on His altar-throne, that He may look 
down upon us, love us with His Sacred Heart, and, 
loving us infinitely, bless us. O, how good is our 
gentle Jesus! How many tender inventions of love 
has He devised to show His love to us and win our 
love in return! When thus, in Benediction, He is 
raised on high before us amid starry lights and fragrant 
flowers and sweet-smelling incense, let us lift up our 
hearts to Him and ask Him very ardently to make us 
love Him. Let us tell Him all our wants, thank Him 
for all His love, ask Him that one day we may see His 
divine face in heaven, which is now veiled under the 
appearance of the little round white Host. Long ago, 
when on earth, having first embraced them, He blessed 
the little children who pressed around Him; so, too, 
He loves us, if we are innocent of heart, and will bless 
us at Benediction. 

Ask the Blessed Virgin, St. Joseph, and your guardian 
angel to aid you in assisting worthily at Benediction. 



PRAYERS AT BENEDICTION. 
I. 



O 



JESUS, Who art about to give Thy Benediction 
to me, and to all who are here present, I humbly 
beseech Thee that it may impart to each and all of us 
the special graces we need. Yet more than this I ask. 
Let Thy blessing go forth far and wide. Let it be felt 



Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, 543 

in the souls of the afflicted who can not come here to 
receive it at Thy feet. Let the weak and tempted 
feel its power wherever they may be. Let poor sinners 
feel its influence, arousing them to come to Thee. Grant 
to me, O Lord, and to all here present, a strong, per 
sonal love of Thee, a lively horror of sin, a higher esteem 
of grace, great zeal for Thy honor and glory, for the 
interest of Thy Sacred Heart, for the salvation of souls, 
for our sanctification and that of all those confided 
to our care, and grant that in our intercourse with others 
we may lead many souls to Thee. Amen. 

II. 

f~\ DIVINE Redeemer of our souls, Who of Thy 
^-^ great goodness hast been pleased to leave us 
Thy precious body and blood in the Most Holy Sac 
rament of the Altar, we adore Thee with the most pro 
found respect, and return Thee our most humble thanks 
for all the favors Thou hast bestowed upon us, espe 
cially for the institution of this Most Holy Sacrament. 
As Thou art the source of every blessing, we entreat 
Thee to pour down Thy benediction this day upon us, 
and upon all those for whom we offer our prayers. 
And that nothing may interrupt the course of Thy 
blessing, take from our hearts whatever is displeasing 
to Thee. Pardon our sins, O my God, which, for the 
love of Thee, we sincerely detest; purify our hearts, 
sanctify our souls, and bestow a blessing on us like 
that which Thou didst grant to Thy disciples at Thy 
Ascension into heaven; grant us a blessing that may 
change us, consecrate us, and unite us perfectly to 
Thee, and fill us with Thy spirit, and be to us in this 
life a foretaste of those blessings which Thou hast pre 
pared for Thy elect in Thy heavenly kingdom. Amen.*

ourselves profoundly, and beg of Thee pardon for our sins. 
We adore Thee, omnipotent Father, and with the out 
pouring of our hearts we thank Thee for having given us Thy 
divine Son Jesus to be our redeemer, and for having left Him 
with us to the consummation of the world in the most 
august sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, in which mystery 
of faith and love he reveals to us the wonders of His sacred 
Heart. Gloria Patri. 

O DIVINE Word, most adorable Jesus, we adore Thee in 
Thy sacrament, and with the outpouring of our hearts 
we thank Thee for having taken human flesh and for having 
made Thyself, for our redemption, priest and victim in the 
sacrifice of the cross, a sacrifice which, by an excess of the 
love of Thy adorable Heart, Thou dost renew every moment 
on our altars throughout the world. O supreme priest, O 
divine victim, grant that we may honor the sacrifice of the 
most holy Eucharist with the united homage of most holy 
Mary and of all Thy Church, in triumph, in suffering, and 
in warfare. We offer ourselves wholly to Thee, and since 
Thou dost deign to have victims associated with Thee, accept 
our offering, and, uniting it withThine, bless us. Gloria Patri. 

O DIVINE Spirit and Paraclete, we adore Thee, and 
with the outpouring of our hearts we thank Thee for hav 
ing with so much love for us wrought the ineffable blessing 
of the incarnation of the divine Word, a benefit which is 
continually being extended and increased in the most holy 
Eucharist. By this adorable mystery of the love of the 
Sacred Heart of Jesus, grant to us and to all sinners Thy 
grace; pour out upon us and upon all redeemed souls Thy 
holy gifts, but in a special manner bestow them upon the 
holy Church, the spouse of Jesus Christ and our Mother, upon 
its visible head the Supreme Pontiff, upon all the cardinals, 
the bishops, and pastors of souls, on all priests, and on all 
the other ministers of the sanctuary. Amen. Gloria Patri.

Ebe "Meek Sanctified. 

"TT* COMMENDABLE practice of piety consists in con- 
sA-*i secrating each day of the week to some particular 
devotion. 

Besides honoring the mystery or the- saint of each day, 
and reciting the prayers assigned for it, you should take 
as the object of your endeavors and prayers the correction 
of the principal fault of which you accused yourself in your 
last confession. 

Select some prayers and ejaculations, from the following 
part of this book, appropriate to the devotions assigned 
to each particular day, and say them in connection with 
your daily visit to the Blessed Sacrament.* 

* In the following part we have endeavored, for the sake of 
method, to group and classify in seven sections, under the head 
ings given for the sanctification of the week, namely, Sunday, 
the Holy Trinity: one God; Monday, the Holy Ghost and the 
Holy Souls; Tuesday, the Holy Angels; Wednesday, St. Joseph; 
Thursday, the Blessed Sacrament and the Sacred Heart; Friday, 
the Sacred Heart and the Passion of Our Lord and Saviour, 
and Saturday, the Blessed Virgin, all the prayers and devotions 
appropriate to the various seasons of the whole year. The 
Novenas, however, will be found in a separate group. In regard 
to the devotions of the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Sacrament, 
given under Thursday, the Holy Hour and the Hour of Adora 
tion, i.e., the former in honor of the Suffering Heart of Jesus (to 
render Christ homage in the extreme anguish He suffered on the 
night of His Passion), and the latter in honor of the Blessed 
Sacrament, are kept by Communities mostly on Thursday after 
noon or evening, and prayers to the Sacred Heart as well as to

THE SIGN OF THE CROSS. 
Make the sign of the cross, * saying: 

IN the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of

This sacred sign may be regarded as a compendium of all 
the mysteries of our faith, as a homage rendered to the three 
Persons of the adorable Trinity, as an act of gratitude for all 
that the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, 
ha=&amp;gt; condescended to do in favor of man. 

Indulgence of 100 days. Pius IX., March 23, 1876. 

PRAYERS TO THE MOST HOLY TRINITY TO BE SAID AT

Pope Pius IX., by a brief, December 5, 1876, granted to all the 
faithful, who, with at least contrite heart, during the last half 
hour of the year and the first half hour of the following year, 
shall pray to the Most Holy Trinity in thanksgiving for benefits 
received; beseeching the same Holy Trinity for peace among 
Christian nations, for concord among Christian princes, for the 
conversion of sinners, and for the triumph of holy Mother 
Church and its visible head, the Roman Pontiff, an indulgence of 
7 years.

generally unite prayers to the Sacred Heart of Jesus with devo

given to the Sacred Heart as well as to the Passion, but the 
prayers for Sacred Heart devotions will be found, as we have 
said, under Thursday.

PRAYER POR SUNDAY TO THE BLESSED TRINITY. 

BLESSED Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
the Source and Fountain of all good, I most 
firmly believe in You, I most humbly adore You, and 
thank You with a grateful heart for all the blessings 
and benefits I have received from Your infinite good 
ness. I most fervently consecrate and offer to You 
an unreserved sacrifice of my whole being. O my God, 
Who hast a right to every day, hour, and moment of 
my existence, accept the thoughts, words, and actions 
of this day, which I offer Thee in testimony of my 
sincere desire to satisfy my obligation of keeping it 
holy and as the first-fruits of the week; mercifully 
assist me to spend it in such a manner as may draw 
down Thy blessing. Increase in my soul the heavenly 
virtues of faith, hope, and charity, which I received 
at baptism, and teach me to make faith the rule of my 
conduct, that thereby it may avail me to life everlasting. 
Eternal Father, take possession of my memory; efface 
from it all images of vanity, and engrave therein the 
recollection of Thy adorable presence. Eternal Son, 
enlighten my understanding, and conduct me in the 
path of salvation by the light of faith. Holy Spirit, 
sanctify my will by the most ardent love; render it sub 
missive under the contradictions of this life, and never 
permit that by attachment to my own ideas or judg 
ment, I should forfeit the blessings of peace offered 
to men of good-will and obedient minds. Holy, ador 
able, undivided Trinity, by Whose power, mercy, and 
providence I was created, redeemed, regenerated, and 
preserved to this moment, receive the oblation of my 
whole being, and take me out of the world rather than 
permit me to efface Your sacred image in my soul by 
mortal sin. I adore You, O Holy Trinity, I worship 
You, I most humbly give You thanks for having revealed 
to man this glorious, this incomprehensible mystery,

Thee, until, being entirely consumed by holy love of 
Thee, I may go to love Thee eternally with the elect 
in heaven, the country of pure love. Amen.

THE PRACTICE OF THE SEVEN GLORIA PATRIS IN HONOR OF 
THE HOLY SPIRIT. 

Indulgence of 7 days. Pius IX., March 12, 1857. 

INDULGENCES GRANTED FOR THIS NOVENA TO THE HOLY 
GHOST. 

Pope Leo XIII., May 9, 1897, decreed that a novena to the 
Holy Ghost should be made every year in preparation for the 
Feast of Pentecost, and granted an indulgence of seven years 
and seven quarantines for each day of the novena, and plenary 
indulgence any one day of the novena on the usual conditions. 
The same indulgences may be gained any day of the week between 
Pentecost and Trinity Sunday. 

Novena to tbc Ibolg &amp;lt;Sbo0t in preparation for tbe 
ffeast of ipentecoet. 

(Commencing on Ascension Day.} 

E novena of the Holy Spirit is the chief of all the 
novenas, because it was the first that was ever cele 
brated, and that by the holy apostles and the most holy 
Mary in the supper-room, being distinguished by so many 
remarkable wonders and gifts; principally by the gift of 
the same Holy Spirit, a gift merited for us by the Passion 
of Jesus Christ Himself. Jesus Himself made this known 
to us when He said to His disciples that if He did npt die 
He could not send us the Holy Ghost: "If I go not, the Para 
clete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to 
you" (John xvi. 7). We know well by faith that the Holy 
Ghost is the love that the Father and the Eternal Word bear 
one to the other; and therefore the gift of love, which the 
Lord infuses into our souls, and which is the greatest of all 
gifts, is particularly attributed to the Holy Ghost. As St. 
Paul says, "The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts 
by the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us" (Rom. v. 5). In 
this novena, therefore, we must consider, above all. the 
great value of divine love, in order that we may desire to 
obtain it, and endeavor, by devout exercises, and especially 
by prayer, to be made partakers of it, since God has promised

it to him who asks for it with humility: "Your Father from 
heaven will give the good Spirit to them that ask Him" (Luke 
xi. 13).*

VARIOUS PRAYERS SUITABLE FOR A NOVENA TO THE 
HOLY GHOST. 

Prayer for the Feast of Pentecost, 

f\ HOLY Spirit, O my God, I adore Thee, and 
^"^ acknowledge, here in Thy divine presence, that 
I am nothing and can do nothing without Thee. Come, 
great Paraclete, Thou Father of the poor, Thou Com 
forter the best, fulfil the promise of our blessed Saviour, 
Who would not leave us orphans, and come into the 
mind and the heart of Thy poor, unworthy creature, 
as Thou didst descend on the sacred day of Pentecost 
on the holy Mother of Jesus and on His first disciples. 
Grant that I may participate in those gifts which Thou

gation. Any prayer to the Holy Ghost will suffice.

didst communicate to them so wonderfully, and with 
so much mercy and generosity. Take from my heart 
whatever is not pleasing to Thee, and make of it a 
worthy dwelling-place for Thyself. Illumine my mind, 
that I may see and understand the things that are for 
my eternal good. Inflame my heart with pure love of 
Thee, that it may be cleansed from the dross of all 
inordinate attachments, and that my whole life may 
be hidden with Jesus in God. Strengthen my will, that 
it may be made conformable to Thy divine will, and 
be guided by Thy holy inspirations. Aid me by Thy 
grace to practice the divine lessons of humility, pov 
erty, obedience, and contempt of the world, which Jesus 
taught us in His mortal life. 

Oh, rend the heavens, and come down, consoling 
Spirit! that inspired and encouraged by Thee, I may 
faithfully comply with the duties of my holy state, 
carry my daily cross most patiently, and endeavor to 
accomplish the divine will with the utmost perfection. 
Spirit of love! Spirit of purity! Spirit of peace ! sanctify 
my soul more and more, and give me that heavenly 
peace which the world can not give. Bless our Holy 
Father, the Pope, bless the Church, bless our bishops, 
our priests, all Religious Orders, and all the faithful, 
that they may be filled with the spirit of Christ, and 
labor earnestly for the spread of His kingdom. 

O Holy Spirit, Thou Giver of every good and perfect 
gift, grant me, I beseech Thee, the intentions of this 
novena. May Thy will be done in me and through 
me. Mayest Thou be praised and glorified for ever 
more! Amen.

of Jesus, as a holocaust to Thee, O Thou consuming 
fire, being firmly resolved, now more than ever, to hear 
Thy voice, and to do, in all things, Thy most holy and 
adorable will. 

I am resolved to foster a special devotion to Thee, to 
love Thee more perfectly, to adore Thee more fervently, 
and to make Thee everywhere more known and loved. 

OFFERING TO THE HOLY GHOST. 

N my knees, before the multitude of heavenly 
witnesses, I offer myself, soul and body, to Thee, 
Eternal Spirit of God! I adore Thee, great God, and 
acknowledge Thy dominion over me. 

Thou art the light and the strength of my soul. In 
Thee I live and move and have my being. I desire 
never to grieve Thee by unfaithfulness to grace, and 
I pray with all my heart to be kept from the smallest 
sin against Thee. Make me faithful in every thought, 
and grant that I may always listen to Thy voice, watch 
for Thy light, and follow Thy gracious inspirations. 
I cling to Thee, and give myself to Thee, and ask Thee, 
by Thy compassion, to watch over me in my weakness. 
Holding the pierced feet of Jesus, and looking at His 
five wounds, and trusting to His precious blood, and 
adoring His open side and stricken Heart, I implore 
Thee, adorable Spirit, Helper of my infirmity, so to 
keep me in Thy grace that I may never sin against 
Thee with the sin which Thou canst not forgive. Give 
me grace, O Holy Ghost, Spirit of the Father and the 
Son, to say to Thee, always and everywhere, "Speak, 
Lord, for Thy servant heareth."

THE HOLY GHOST AND RELIGIOUS ORDERS. 

ELIGIOUS should ever bear in mind that the great 
Orders and Congregations of the Church are the 
special work of the Holy Ghost, and that their personal 
call to the holy state of life in which they are living is a 
special grace of the Divine Spirit, to Whom, therefore, they 



Monday: The Holy Ghost. 567 

should have or cultivate a special devotion. To the soul of 
every Religious, these words of the Holy Ghost may be 
applied in a particular manner: "Behold, I will allure her, 
and I will lead her into the wilderness; and I will speak to 
her heart." 

Father Marianus Fiege, O.M.Cap., writes on this sub 
ject in "The Paraclete": 

You who are a Religious, tell me, who "allured" you 
away from the vanities of a deceitful world? Who "led" 
you to your abode of sweet seclusion and retirement ? Who 
first "spoke to your heart" of the peaceful service of God 
in the cloister? Who encouraged and strengthened you to 
"leave all things and follow Christ?" Who enabled you 
10 consummate the sacrifice, when by the three vows of 
poverty, chastity, and obedience, you made of yourself a 
whole burnt-offering, and fastened yourself, so to speak, 
with Jesus to the cross? Who has ever since that moment 
enabled you to be faithful to the solemn promises you then 
made, and to be diligent in the discharge of the sublime 
duties of your noble calling? Who still aids you to lead 
that life of prayer and recollection, so necessary to you? 
Who is the source and fount of the interior life you now 
lead a life utterly unknown to the lovers of the world? 
Who gives you strength to practice the virtues befitting your 
exalted state? Who encourages and comforts you amidst 
the many trials and hardships incident to your mode of life ? 
"I will speak, and do thou answer me." Is not all this the 
special work of the Holy Ghost, Who has singled you out 
from among the rest of mankind and called you to this blessed 
state of life? 

Religious soul! How can you be conscious of all you owe 
to the Holy Ghost, without cultivating a special devotion 
to Him in yourself, and others under your influence? Let 
the Spirit of God reign entirely in your hearts; let the fire 
of His love purify your hearts; let His will dominate your 
energies; then you will live, labor, and suffer for Him; then 
you will be filled with zeal for the glory of God and the sal 
vation of souls. 

Make a daily act of consecration to the Holy Ghost ; trust 
in Him; love Him; think of Him; pray to Him in every 
important undertaking; beseech Him for a more perfect 



568 Monday: The Holv Ghost. 

following of Christ, and being yourself filled with the Divine 
Spirit, make known His gracious attributes everywhere, so 
that all may come under the sweet empire of His love and 
mercy, thus finding rest to their soul s eternal salvation. 

A PRAYER FOR THE CONVERSION OF UNBELIEVERS. 

OHOLY Spirit of truth, we beseech Thee to enlighten the 
minds of unbelievers in the midst of us, to incline their 
hearts to receive Thy word, and to believe the teachings of 
Thy Church; give them courage to accept the faith and 
openly profess it; that they may come into union with Thee 
and the Father, through Christ our Lord, Who liveth and 
reigneth for ever and ever. Amen. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

THANKSGIVING, CONSECRATION, AND PRAYER TO THE HOLV 
GHOST. 

OLY Spirit, divine Consoler! I adore Thee as my true 
God. I bless Thee by uniting myself to the praises 
Thou dost receive from the angels and the saints. I offer 
Thee my whole heart, and I render Thee heartfelt thanks 
for all the benefits that Thou hast bestowed and dost 
unceasingly bestow upon the world. Thou, Who art the 
Author of all supernatural gifts and Who didst enrich with 
immense favors the soul of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the 
Mother of God, I beseech Thee to visit me by Thy grace 
and Thy love, and to grant me Thy sevenfold gift, in order 
that I may with constant love and perseverance walk in 
the way of my eternal salvation. 

PRAYERS TO THE HOLY GHOST IN CONNECTION WITH DEVO 
TIONS TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT.* 
I. 

OHOLY Ghost, help me to receive Jesus with love and 
reverence. Thou art my Teacher and my Sanctifier, 
and by Thee I live. Thou givest light and strength to my 
soul. Jesus, hidden in the Blessed Sacrament, is my Saviour 
and my God. I long to be with Him, that He may abide 
more in me and I in Him. He is the Bread of life, the 
true Bread of God. I long to feed with adoration on that 
living Bread. Be with me, O Blessed Spirit, as in this great 
light I draw near to the altar, and give me always more 
faithfulness to Jesus and more love for Him. 

* From Father Rawes "Bread of Life."

II. 

the light of the tabernacle I ask Thee, O Holy Ghost, 
to fill my heart with pure desire for Jesus, the living 
Bread. Give me grace to adore Him with the holy angels, 
that His will may be done cm earth as it is in heaven, and 
that His will may be done in my soul. Help me to thank 
Him for all His gifts, and most of all for Himself. By this 
Holy Sacrament He strengthens souls on earth, and gives 
rest to souls in purgatory, and gladdens souls in heaven. 
He is the hidden Manna, promised by Himself to all who 
overcome. Thy grace will bring me in safety to God. May 
I taste the sweetness of Jesus! May my soul be kept by 
Thee very bright for the coming of my Spouse! 

III. 

OLEANSE my heart, O Holy Spirit, by this heavenly food, 
wherein Jesus gives me Himself. Strengthen my faith, 
that I may see Jesus in this Sacrament of His body and 
blood. There is in me a law by which I am in danger of 
falling into the captivity of sin. I have often to go on my 
heavenward way through darkness and many temptations, 
but Thou art my light and my strength. In Thee I trust. 
By Thy grace I can do all things that Jesus wishes me to 
do. Be ever in my soul as the dew of the light. With 
utter trust I rest upon Thee, and believe the testimony 
which Thou givest. Set up more and more Thy kingdom 
in my soul, that I may keep my body under, and bring it to 
subjection, lest I should be a castaway from Jesus and from 
Thee. 

IV. 

OHOLY Ghost, let my life be hidden with Jesus in 
God. Give me grace to live for God only, and to 
use creatures in Him and for His sake. Let the beauty 
of God blind me to the beauty of the world, and let the 
light of God blind me to the light of earth. Thou, O my 
God, art brighter than all things and sweeter. Take away 
from my soul all the dross, and purify it, giving it light 
and strength. To Thee, Spirit of deathless love, I turn 
for help. Take from me all human respect; for wrong 
regard of creatures blights the soul, so that its fruits are 
withered. Help me to be more faithful to Jesus, my Love, 
Who is coming to me from His altar. He is my life, as Thou 
art my life, and as the eternal Father is my life. Give me 
more love, that I may welcome Jesus as He comes to me 
in the hidden light, and the freshness of the morning dew. 



57 Monday: The Holy Ghost. 

V. 

OHOLY Ghost, fill me with the fear of the Lord, and 
drive far from me all thoughts of presumption. 
Save me from guilt like this. Keep me from offending 
God; and keep me from the wounds of His anger. Make 
me feel His goodness, and fill my heart with thankfulness. 
If I am faithful to Thee, Thou wilt give me much grace; if 
I am unfaithful, Thou wilt give me little grace, or, it may 
be, none at all. Dwell in my soul more and more, that I 
may be faithful with a great faithfulness, and inherit the 
fulness of Thy promises. 

VI. 

OHOLY Ghost, give me a great hunger for the Bread 
of life. Do Thou, by that Bread which is Jesus, satisfy 
my soul, and strengthen it, and make it full of life. I am 
needy with a great need; but this Bread of heaven is the 
life of the poor; let it be my life. I am very poor and 
needy; but Thou, my own Lord, dost always care for me. 
^yithout Thee, Blessed Spirit, I can not say, Jesus: without 
Thee, Helper of the needy, I can not feed on Him Who is 
the Bread from heaven. 

O Spirit of peace, give me a great love for the holy sac 
rifice of the Mass. 

Spirit of reconciliation, help all darkened souls, and 
bring them back to life. 

O Spirit of mercy, help the souls that are now suffering 
in the fire of purgatory. I ask Thee, by Thine own good 
ness, to give them refreshment and joy and white robes of 
consoling love. 

O most pitiful Spirit, give me a great joy in this Sacra 
ment of love. Thou dwellest in me, and by Thee I live 
to God. Thou makest me a temple of Thyself and of the 
Father and the Son. Thou makest me an heir of God. 
Bring me now, dear Spirit, in light to the altar; bring me 
in light to my grave ^ bring me in light to the city of the 
King and the song of the morning stars. 

VII. 

TERNAL Father, wash me from my sins in the blood 
. of Jesus. 

Eternal Son, fill me with the fire of Thy Heart. 
Eternal Spirit, make me glad with the sweetness of the soul 
of Jesus. 

O eternal Father, crush all the powers of evil under my feet. 
Let me walk upon the asp and the basilisk; let me trample 
under foot the lion and the dragon by the blood of Thy Son. 



Monday: The Faithful Departed. 571 

O eternal Son, pour into my soul abundant gifts of grace. 
Thou didst die for me on the cross. There Thou didst 
merit for me the treasures of grace which now Thou givest. 
Thou didst give me Thyself in shedding of blood and in 
dimness of death. Now Thou givest me Thyself in out 
pouring of gladness and in Thy deathless life. Thou wast 
dead, and art alive for ever. 

O eternal Spirit, hide me more and more with God, and 
let there be in me more and more of the mind of Jesus. 
Touch the lips of my soul and give me a taste for this Bread 
of God, that I may know the graciousness of my Jesus, and 
the sweetness of His blood. The love of God is shed abroad 
in my heart, for Thou, O Holy Ghost, art given to me. Oh, 
lift me up, dear Spirit, from the dust. Oh, bring me in 
Thine own good time to the pavement of pure gold as clear 
as crystal. Fill my soul with Thy dew ; fill it with Thy fire. 
There is no dew like Thine; and there is no fire like Thine. 
They mingle together in the fruitfulness of the garden of 
the Spouse. They mingle with the blood of Jesus, and 
with the water from His side. Oh, fire of the Holy Ghost, 
gentle and sweet as dew! Oh, dew of the Holy Ghost, pierc 
ing and cleansing as fire! O Holy Ghost, Whom I love, lift 
Thy little one to Thine uncreated Heart. 

O Blessed Trinity, show me the hidden things of the 
blood of Jesus, the holy mystery of Thy Church. O Blessed 
Trinity: O Blessed Trinity: O Blessed Trinity. 



Devotions for tbe ffaitbful Beparteo* 

THE HEROIC ACT OF CHARITY. 

An offering of all works of satisfaction and of all the suffrages 

in behalf of the souls in purgatory. 

HIS heroic act of charity in behalf of the souls in purgatory 
consists in a voluntary offering made in their favor to 
the divine Majesty, by any one of the faithful, of all works of 
satisfaction done by him in his life, as well as of all the suf 
frages which shall be offered for him after his death. Many 
of the faithful, devout to the Blessed Virgin, have followed 
the praiseworthy practice, introduced, or at least much 
spread since the last century, by, F. D. Gaspar Oliden, Thea- 
tine, of placing them in the hands of the Blessed Virgin, 
that she may distribute them in behalf of those souls whom 
it is her good pleasure to deliver sooner from the pains of 
purgatory. This heroic act of charity has been enriched 
with many indulgences. 



572 Monday: The Faithful Departed. 

As the " New Raocolta " tells us, a plenary indulgence, appli 
cable only to the departed, is granted to all the faithful who 
shall have made this offering, whenever they go to hol&amp;gt; 
communion, provided they visit a church or public oratory, 
and pray there, for some time, for the intention of his Holiness. 

A plenary indulgence, every Monday, to all who hear Mass 
in aid of the souls in purgatory, provided they fulfil the 
other conditions mentioned above. 

All indulgences granted or to be granted, which are to be 
gained by the faithful who have made this offering, may be 
applied to the holy souls in purgatory. 

Although this act of charity is called heroic vow of chanty in 
some printed sheets, in which also is given a formula for 
making the offering, no inference is to be drawn therefrom 
that this offering binds under sin; neither is it necessary 
to make use of the said formula, or any other, since, in order 
to share in the said indulgences, no more is required than 
a heartfelt act of the will. 

The heroic act of charity is not a vow ; nor does this offer 
ing prevent the maker of it from praying for himself, for 
his friends, or any other like intention, as by it he only 
foregoes that special fruit of his good works, which would 
telong to himself, as a satisfaction for the temporal punish 
ment deserved by him on account of his sins. 

" It is sometimes objected," we read in Murray s " Guide to 
Indulgences," "that this act of charity does an injustice to 
ourselves, because it takes away what is necessary to satisfy 
God s justice for our sins, and so leaves us much more suffering 
to endure in purgatory than would otherwise fall to our share. 

"The answer to this is, that even if this lengthening of 
our own punishment was an assured fact, it would be a 
small price to pay for the immense reward that God would 
bestow in heaven on those who performed such an heroic 
act of charity. But it is not true that those who make 
this offering will suffer more on account of it, for we may 
be sure that God would not have it so. On the contrary, 
He will reward those who are so generous by enkindling such 
a great love for Himself in their hearts that it will result 
in a full forgiveness not only of sin, but also of its tem 
poral punishment; and, moreover, He has still the right to 
make their souls, if they go to purgatory, the beneficiaries 
of those prayers and good works which the living are con 
tinually offering Him." 

Besides, those souls who may be released from their suffer 
ings by these heroic offerings will not prove ungrateful, 
but rather will they constantly intercede for those to 



Monday: The Faithful Departed. 573 

whom they owe their deliverance, and will not cease their 
prayers until the latter are either brought straight to heaven, 
or released from purgatory. 

REFLECTIONS. 

*T would seem like carrying coals to Newcastle, or water 
to the river, to exhort Religious to exercise charity 
by offering their suffrages in behalf of the poor, holy souls 
in purgatory. 

The true and zealous Religious will not fail to offer the 
holy sacrifice of the Mass and holy communion very fre 
quently for the faithful departed. The Way of the Cross, 
the Rosary, Novenas, and Litanies are good devotions for 
the same purpose. The De Profundis, besides other indul- 
genced prayers and ejaculations, should be made use of 
daily and frequently during the day in aid of the poor souls. 

The good Religious will nourish the most tender com 
passion for those who are now absolutely incapable of assist 
ing themselves, and who must remain separated from God un 
til the last farthing is paid, either by their own sufferings, 
or by the interposition of the faithful. Many powerful 
motives should induce you to be most fervent in assisting 
them: By this spiritual work of mercy you prove your love 
for God, you benefit your neighbor, and acquire great merit 
for yourself. You prove your love for God by interceding 
for those holy souls who are so dear to His divine Majesty, 
and whom He so ardently longs to glorify for ever. You 
perform an act of the greatest charity toward these suffer 
ing, holy souls, by endeavoring to shorten their banish 
ment where they are tortured by a fire far more terrible 
than any earthly fire, and deprived of the sight of God, a 
torment more excruciating than all other pains. And you 
essentially serve your own soul by providing for yourself 
powerful advocates who will not forget you when they 
stand before God. 

Let these considerations animate you to do all you can 
for the souls in purgatory. Devote fervently many prayers, 
good works, and various actions and mortifications to their 
relief, and endeavor to gain many indulgences for their 
benefit. Offer up, in particular, the holy sacrifice of the 
Mass on Mondays for this intention. But you should par 
ticularly impress on your mind that sloth or negligence in 
the prayers or actions which you offer for the suffering souls 
would make you very unworthy of being heard, and, far 
from benefiting those for whom you pray, you would only 
expose yourself to a severe purgatory hereafter in the same 
fire which torments them. 



574 Monday: The Faithful Departed. 



PRAYER TO BE SAID ON MONDAY. 

OGOD of all holiness, infinitely pure and adorable Being! 
how great must be Thy horror of the least stain of sin, 
since Thou punishest so rigorously in the flames of purgatory 
the venial faults of those whom Thou so tenderly lovest. 
Ah! mercifully enlighten my understanding, that the tor 
ments Thou inflictest on the least offence in the other world, 
may teach me the enormity of sin, and penetrate my heart 
with compassion for those souls who are now enduring inex 
pressible pains for such failings as perhaps I too often look 
on as trivial. My God, though Thy justice banishes them 
from that kingdom where nothing defiled can enter, yet 
surely Thy mercy has not forgotten them ; no, Thou art 
too good, too compassionate to abandon the work of Thine 
own hands. Though the season for merit and repentance 
is now past for them, yet Thou hast left them a resource 
in the prayers of Thy servants on earth. Despise not, then, 
O Lord, the supplication which I, Thy unworthy child, 
now make for those who can no longer implore Thy mercy 
for themselves. Remember, O infinite Goodness, that they 
are all the work of Thy hands, redeemed by the precious 
blood of Thine only Son ; consider that they are the objects 
of Thine infinite love, who burn with the most ardent desire 
to be united to Thee. Have mercy on them, then, O infinite 
Mercy! and for Thine own sake stretch forth to their relief 
those sacred hands by which they were formed, and apply 
to them once more the merits of that adorable blood by 
which they were redeemed. I most humbly offer up, to 
implore this favor, the adorable sacrifice of the Mass, in 
union with all the Masses which will be celebrated through 
out, the world to-day. 

In union, also, with the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, I 
offer all my prayers, works, and sufferings this day for the 
relief of the holy souls. 

Mercifully accept this oblation, O Lord, on behalf of 
all who now suffer in purgatory, particularly those for 
whom Thou desirest I should pray those who are most 
dear to me those to whose sufferings I may have been in 
any respect accessory those who are most forgotten by 
others, and who have no one to pray for them. Give them 
all speedy repose and eternal rest, O merciful Father of all 
mankind, and give me the grace to spend this day in such a 
manner that through Thy infinite goodness, I may obtain 
\.he relief of these suffering and blessed souls.

A PRAYER TO THE GUARDIAN ANGEL. 

O ANGEL of God, my blessed protector, to whose care 
I have been committed by my Creator from the moment 
of my birth, unite with me in thanking the Almighty for having 
given me a friend, an instructor, an advocate, and a guardian 
in thee. Accept, O most charitable guide, my fervent thanks 
giving for all thou hast done for me; particularly for the 
charity with which thou didst undertake to accompany me 
through life; for the joy with which thou wert filled when 
I was purified in the waters of Baptism; and for thy anxious 
solicitude in watching over the treasures of my innocence. 
Thou knowest the numberless graces and favors which my 
Creator has bestowed on me through thee, and the many 
dangers, both spiritual and temporal, from which thou hast 
preserved me. Thou knowest how often thou didst deplore 
my sins, animate me to repentance, and intercede with God 
for my pardon. Ah! why have I so little merited a con 
tinuance of thy zealous efforts for my salvation? Why have 
I so often stained my soul by sin, and thereby rendered 
myself unworthy of the presence and protection of an angel, 



Tuesday: The Holy Angels. 5,^ 

of so pure a spirit as thou art, who never sinned? But, 
as my ingratitude and thoughtlessness have not lessened 
thy charitable interest for my salvation, so neither shall they 
diminish my confidence in thy goodness, nor prevent me 
from abandoning myself to thy care, since God Himself has 
entrusted thee with the charge of my soul. Penetrated with 
sorrow for the little progress I have made in virtue, though 
blessed with such a Master, and sincerely determined to 
correspond in future with thy exertions for my salvation, I 
most earnestly entreat thee, O protecting spirit, to continue 
thy zealous efforts for my eternal interest; to fortify my 
weakness, to shield me from the innumerable dangers of 
the world, and to obtain by thy powerful prayers that my 
life may rather be shortened, than that I should live to com 
mit a mortal sin. Remember, O most happy spirit, that it 
was one act of profound humility, and one transport of ardent 
love for thy Creator, that caused God to establish thee forever 
in glory; obtain that those virtues may be implanted in my 
soul, and that I may seriously endeavor to acquire docility, 
obedience, gentleness, and purity of heart. Conduct me 
safely through this world of sin and misery; watch over me 
at the awful hour of my death; perform for my soul the last 
charitable office of thy mission, by strengthening, encouraging, 
and supporting me in the agonies of dissolution, and then, as 
the angel Raphael conducted Tobias safely to his father, 
do thou, my good angel and blessed guide, return with me 
to Him Who sent thee, that we may mutually bless Him, and 
publish His wonderful works for a happy eternity. Amen.

OMOST faithful companion, appointed by God to be

fulness and love, and for all the benefits which thou hast 
conferred upon me? Thou watchest over me while I sleep; 
thou comfortest me when I am sad; thou liftest me up when 
I am down; thou avertest the dangers that threaten me; 
thou warnest me of those that are to come; thou withdrawest 
me from sin, and excitest me to good, thou exhortest me to 
penance when I fall, and reconcilest me to God. Long ago 
should I have been thrust down into hell, unless by thy 
prayers thou hadst turned away from me the anger of God. 
Leave me not, nor forsake me ever, I beseech thee; but still 
comfort me in adversity, restrain me in prosperity, defend 
me in danger, assist me in temptations, lest at any time I 
fall beneath them. Offer up in the sight of the divine 
Majesty my prayers and all my works of piety, and make 
me to persevere in grace until I come to everlasting life.

Devotions in Ibonor of St. Sosepb. 

DEVOTION OF THE SEVEN SUNDAYS IN HONOR OF ST. 
JOSEPH. 

E Sovereign Pontiffs who have so gloriously occupied 
the chair of St. Peter in later days have enriched 

with great indulgences this tender devotion, in order to 

stimulate the faithful to its ora.ct.ioe. 



586 Wednesday: St. Joseph. 

In virtue of a concession of Pope Gregory XVI. we may 
gain an indulgence of 300 days on each of the first six Sun 
days, and a plenary indulgence on the seventh Sunday, for 
saying the prayers of the Seven Sorrows and Joys of St. 
Joseph on any seven consecutive Sundays of the year. 

On February i, 1847, Pope Pius IX., of holy memory, 
wishing to extend this devotion, added to the indulgences 
already granted a plenary indulgence on each Sunday, appli 
cable to the souls in purgatory. 

On March 2^d of the same year his Holiness extended 
this indulgence to those who, owing to some good cau r e, 
being unable to recite the prayers of the Seven Sorrows and 
Joys of St. Joseph, say seven Our Fathers, seven Hail Marys, 
and seven Glorias, fulfilling the usual conditions for gaining 
a plenary indulgence, namely, confesncn, communion, and 
prayers for our holy mother the Church. 

The Sovereign Pontiff, Pius VII., Dec. 9, 1819, granted an 
indulgence of 100 days, once a day; an indulgence of 300 days, 
every Wednesday in the year, and on every day of the two novenas 
preceding the feasts of St. Joseph, viz., the principal feast, March 
19, and the feast of the patronage, the third Sunday after Easter. 
A plenary indulgence, on these two feasts, to all those who, more 
over, being truly penitent, shall have gone to confession and com 
munion. A plenary indulgence, once a month, to all those who 
shall have said them every day for a month, on the day when, 
being truly penitent, they shall go to confession and communion. 

DEVOUT EXERCISE IN HONOR OF THE SEVEN SORROWS AND 
SEVEN JOYS OF ST. JOSEPH. 

1. "T^URE husband of most holy Mary, glorious St. 
J Joseph, great was the travail and anguish of 

thy heart when, in sore perplexity, thou didst feel inclined 
to put away thy stainless spouse; but unspeakable was thy 
joy when the angel revealed to thee the high mystery of the 
Incarnation. 

By this, thy sorrow and thy joy, we pray thee, comfort 
our souls now and in their dying agony with the sweet con 
solation of a well-spent life, and a death like unto thine own, 
in the embrace of Jesus and of Mary. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

2. Thrice happy patriarch, glorious St. Joseph, chosen 
to be the foster-father of the Word made man, keen was the 
pain thou didst feel when thou didst see the infant Jesus born 
in abject poverty; but thy pain was suddenly changed into 



Wednesday: St. Joseph. 587 

heavenly joy when upon thee burst the harmony of the angel- 
choirs, and thou didst behold the glory of that refulgent 
night. 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, we pray thee, obtain for 
us that, when the journey of our life is over, we too may 
pass to that blessed land where we shall hear the angel- 
chants, and enjoy the brightness of celestial glory. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

3. O thou who wast ever most obedient in fulfilling the 
law of God, glorious St. Joseph! when, at His circumcision, 
the infant Saviour s precious blood was shed, thy heart was 
pierced through and through; but with the name of Jesus 
came again to thee new life and heavenly joy. 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, obtain for us that, freed 
in life from the vile yoke of sin, we too may die with joy, 
with the sweet name of Jesus in our hearts and on our lips. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

4. Faithful saint, who wast admitted to take part in man s 
redemption, glorious St. Joseph, Simeon s prophecy of the 
coming woes of Jesus and of Mary filled thy soul with agony 
like death: but thy soul was filled with blessedness when 
he foretold salvation and glorious resurrection to innumerable 
souls. 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, help us with thy prayers 
to be of those who, by the merits of Jesus and His virgin 
Mother, shall be partakers of the glorious resurrection. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

5. Watchful guardian, bosom-friend of the Incarnate Son 
of God, glorious St. Joseph, how didst thou toil to nurture 
and to serve the Son of the Most High, especially in the 
flight into Egypt; but far greater was thy joy in having with 
thee God Himself, and in seeing Egypt s idols fall to the 
earth! 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, obtain for us to keep aloof 
from the infernal tyrant, quitting all dangerous occasions, 
that all earthly idols may be cast out from our hearts, and 
that, employed in the service of Jesus and Mary, we may 
ever live for them alone, and with them calmly die. 

Our Father, Haii Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

6. Angel on earth, glorious St. Joseph, while thou didst 
marvel at seeing the King of heaven obedient to thy bidding, 



588 Wednesday: SI. Joseph. 

fear of the tyrant mingled with thy joy when thou didst bring 
him back from Egypt; but, reassured by the angel, thou 
didst dwell at Nazareth with glad heart, in the sweet com 
pany of Jesus and Mary. 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, obtain for us that, with 
hearts set free from every hurtful fear, we too may taste the 
quiet of a tranquil conscience, safely dwelling with Jesus 
and with Mary, and one day die within their loving arms. 

Our Father. Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

7. Pattern of all holiness, glor ous St. Joseph, without 
fault of thine, thou didst lose the holy Child, Jesus, and for 
three days, to thy great sorrow, didst seek for him, until, 
with joy unspeakable, thou didst find thy Life amid the 
Doctors in the Temple. 

By this thy sorrow and thy joy, we pray thee with all our 
heart, stand between as and danger, that we may never lose 
Jesus by mortal sin; but if, to our shame and disgrace, we 
lose him, may we seek him with such ceaseless grief that we 
may find him propitious to us, especially at the hour of our 
death, and thus go to enjoy Him in heaven, and there with 
thee sing His divine mercy for ever! 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

Ant, Jesus was about thirty years old, being, as was sup 
posed, the son of Joseph. 

V. Pray for us, blessed Joseph, 

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ 

Let us pray. 

D, Who in Thine ineffable providence didst vouchsafe 
to choose blessed Joseph to be the husband of Thy 
most holy Mother: grant, we beseech Thee, that we may be 
made worthy to receive him for our intercessor in heaven, 
whom on earth we venerate as our holy protector. Who 
livest and reignest world without end. Amen.

fire with the pure flames of the most ardent charity, and 
whose life was a constant prayer and continual contemplation! 
deign to accept me as thy protege, and to teach me the per 
fection of the interior life. Teach me how to model my heart 
in accordance with the hearts of Jesus and Mary. Direct 
me in the way of salvation, and obtain for me that I may, 
day after day, without interruption, live and labor for God 
and my neighbor in the rigorous observance of my vows. From 
the height of thy throne, where thou reignest in heaven near 
Jesus and Mary, cast thy paternal and compassionate looks 
upon all Religious, and especially upon those of our own 
Order, who are filled with the most profound respect and 
tender veneration for thee. Be a father to us all; inspire 
our Superiors; protect our interests; shield us from danger 
and aid us in the spread of God s kingdom on earth. Obtain 
for all Religious the graces of which they stand in need, in 
order to arrive at the sanctity to which God calls them. 
Especially obtain for them the spirit of prayer, the gift of 
piety, that fervor of which thou art the perfect model. Teach 
them to pray as thou thyself hast learned it from Jesus and 
Mary. 

May they be always animated with the same sentiments 
of humility, purity of intention, respect, docility, faith, con 
fidence, and love, with which thou thyself wert inflamed 
and actuated, when in thy hidden life, in the silence and seclu 
sion of thy poor house at Nazareth, thou didst offer unceas 
ingly with Jesus and Mary the most fervent and acceptable 
prayers to the divine Majesty. Amen.

DEDICATION TO ST. JOSEPH. 

O GLORIOUS descendant of the King of Juda! inheritor 
of the virtues of all the patriarchs! just and happy 
St. Joseph! listen to my prayer. Thou art my glorious pro 
tector, and shalt ever be, after Jesus and Mary, the object 
of my most profound veneration and tender confidence. Thou

iarly the patron of those who serve God with the greatest

purity and fervor. In union with all those who have ever 
been most devoted to thee, I now dedicate myself to thy 
service, beseeching thee, for the sake of Jesus Christ, Who 
vouchsafed to love and obey thee as a son, to become a father 
to me, and to obtain for me the filial respect, confidence, 
and love of a child toward thee. O powerful advocate of 
all Christians! whose intercession, as St. Teresa assures us, 
has never been found to fail, deign to intercede for me now, 
and to obtain for me the particular object of this novena. 
[Specify it.] Present me, O great saint, to the Adorable 
Trinity, with Whom thou hadst so glorious and so intimate 
a correspondence. Obtain that I may never efface by sin 
the sacred image according to the likeness of which I was 
created. Beg for me that my divine Redeemer may enkindlf 
in my heart, and in all hearts, the fire of His love, and infus- 
therein the virtues of His adorable infancy, His purity, sim 
plicity, obedience, and humility. Obtain for me likewise 
a lively devotion to thy virgin spouse, and protect me so 
powerfully in life and death that I may have the happiness 
of dying as thou didst, in the friendship of my Creator, and 
under the immediate protection of the Mother of God. 

For making a novena in honor of St. Joseph, an indulgence of 
300 days, on each day, and a plenary indulgence during the 
novena or on any one of the eight days following it. Pius IX.. 
Nov. 28, 1876. 

AN OFFERING TO ST. JOSEPH. 

f^VREAT St. Joseph, thou generous depositary and 
*S* dispenser of immortal riches, behold us prostrate 
at thy feet, conjuring thee to receive us as thy servants 
and as thy children. Next to the sacred hearts of 
Jesus and Mary, of which thou art the faithful copy, 
we acknowledge that there is no heart more tender, 
more compassionate, than thine. What, then, have 
we to fear, or, rather, for what should we not hope, 
if thou dost deign to be our benefactor, our master, 
our model, our father, and our intercessor! 

Refuse not, then, the favor we ask of thee, O powerful 
protector! We ask it of thee by the love thou hast for

Devotions to tbe Blesseo Sacrament ano to 
tbe Sacreo Ibeart ot Sesus.* 

THE THREE THURSDAYS. 

E Three Thursdays" is not a phrase to which pious 
ears are used, as they are used to "The Nine Fridays." 
Our readers, especially in Ireland and more especially in 
Dublin, are happily familiar with that magnificent exercise 
of persevering faith and piety by which so many continually 
increasing thousands endeavor to gain very special graces 
by receiving holy communion on the first Friday of nine 

* See page 547 for note concerning the intermingling of devo 
tions to the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Sacrament. 



602 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

months following one another without a single break. By 
the way, why nine not fewer and not more ? Was that par 
ticular number honored by Our Lord s choice for this pur 
pose in memory of the first nine months of His human life ? 

But "The Three Thursdays" is only a name by Vvhich 
three special days of the year are perhaps now for the first 
time linked together on account of certain Eucharistic 
associations which I am going to explain Holy Thursday 
Ascension Thursday, and the Feast of Corpus Christi. 
These are the only religious solemnities that are attached 
to the fifth day of the week as such; and they all three 
two of them expressly, and one (as we shall presently 
see) indirectly and by suggestion are special reminders 
and memorials of the Blessed Eucharist. Perhaps some 
devout souls who are eager to seize on any excuse or device 
for renewing their fervor will reproach themselves with 
having too completely overlooked the Eucharistic claims 
of Thursday, and with having scarcely heeded the invitation 
which its associations address to the pious faithful to extend 
practically to all the Thursdays of the year the liturgical 
title of Thursday in Holy Week Feria qidnta in caena Do 
mini, Thursday of the Lord s Supper. 

The first, then, of the Three Thursdays is Maundy Thurs 
day, for which the faithful have, with good reason, invented 
for themselves the name of Holy Thursday, though it is 
not called so in the Missal, as Holy Saturday is. This 
solemn day was not chosen arbitrarily to do honor to the 
Blessed Eucharist, but because it was on this day that Our 
Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled His promise and instituted this 
memorial of His love, on the night before He suffered, on 
the eve of Good Friday. 

So, too, the Feast of the Ascension is not an arbitrary 
feast in the calendar, but is kept on one fixed and deter 
minate Thursday for this reason: because Our Saviour, after 
His Resurrection, lingered on for another forty days in the 
desert of this world, as He had spent forty days in the desert 
at the beginning of Plis public life; and in these forty days 
after Easter Sunday we reach exactly the Thursday of the 
sixth week of Paschal time, which is, therefore, the anni 
versary of Our Lord s Ascension from Mount Olivet, and 
which we therefore call Ascension Thursday. 

The particular date, however, of Corpus Christi, the third 
of these Three Thursdays that I am linking together, was 
not thus fixed beforehand by the circumstances of the 
event that it commemorates; but it was chosen deliberately 
for the following excellent reasons. This great feast of 
the Blessed Sacrament was intended to make amends to 



and the Sacred Heart. 603 

the faithful for the restraints placed on their piety on Holy 
Thursday itself, when the nearness of Good Friday hindered 
them from making it a sufficiently joyful festival. Now, 
what date should be selected for this Eucharistic consecra 
tion, for the fuller gratifying of our pent-up feelings of 
joy and gratitude for the institution of the great banquet 
of love? There was a certain fitness in choosing some day 
that comes as soon as possible after the completion of the 
yearly cycle of feasts which commemorate the events of 
Our Lord s life on earth, ending with the establishment of 
His Church and the descent of the Holy Ghost. That 
cycle closes with Pentecost: what day, therefore, after 
the octave of Whitsunday, shall be the glorious feast of 
reparation and thanksgiving for the Sacrament of the body 
of Our Lord? The Thursday of the first week after Whit 
suntide is Corpus Christi, not preferred at random (as we 
have said several times) to the other days of the week, 
but out of homage to that particular day on which this 
Most Blessed Sacrament was actually instituted. 

Finally, what individual claim can Ascension Thursday 
advance to be ranked as a Eucharistic festival, like the 
two other Thursdays which it comes between? Because 
the commemoration of the departure of our divine Re 
deemer must needs call to our minds His abiding presence 
amongst us. He who is gone stays still. Hundreds of 
years before the Ascension the Royal Psalmist, who fore 
saw it, linked this consolation with his prophecy, or at 
least piety is delighted at discovering this hidden meaning 
in his words: "Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led 
captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts in men" (Psalm 
Ixvii. 19). This was the supreme gift and love-token which, 
if it had not been given already, would have been given 
then, to console those who were left behind in loneliness 
on the mountain of the Ascension. Surely, as all the pathetic 
words spoken at the Last Supper have a deeper force, a 
more poignant significance, if we imagine them repeated 
by Jesus at the very last on Mount Olivet, when the final 
parting had indeed come, as they were repeated (if not with 
His lips) with His Heart; so, too, the "memorial of His 
marvels," memoria mirabilium suorum, the memento that 
He left behind Him, did not take effect, as it were, or come 
fully into play, until His visible presence was actually with 
drawn. And therefore, when Our Redeemer goes from us 
on the clouds of heaven, it is impossible not to try and calm 
our troubled hearts by reminding ourselves of the supreme 
device of His love by means of which, though He has gone 



604 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

He will be with us still. May we not give this meaning 
to the warning of the white-robed angels: Hie Jesus qui 
assumptus est veniet? He will come: He will Himself be 
the greatest of the gifts that He gave to men when ascend 
ing on high. Dedit dona hominibus. 

A holy man,* whose writings are marked by great sobriety 
of thought and the absence of all extravagance, has written: 
"The presence of Our Lord in the tabernacle may be said to 
be the very chief of all the mercies of God to us in our pres 
ent state; more precious than the guardianship of the 
angels of which we think so little, or the practical benefits 
which flow from our membership of the Church, or from 
the prayers and protection of the saints, or even from the 
mightiness and power and vigilant tenderness of the motherly 
care of Mary herself " 

St. Paul s argument aboit the Incarnation applies with over 
whelming force to this special phase or development of the 
Incarnation, in which the Word that was made flesh in order 
to dwell amongst us visibly has disguised that vesture of 
flesh under another form in order to dwell amongst us still, 
corporally and yet invisibly. St. Paul asks: " He that spared 
not even His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how 
hath He not also with Him given us all things?" (Rom. vjii., 
32). And now we too may ask: since Jesus Christ, the 
eternal Son of God, has deigned to give Himself to us in so 
close a union, and to dwell night and day in our midst that 
He may come often into our hearts, what greater proof of 
His love can there be left for Him to give ? And ought not 
our gratitude and our love to be as unceasing and, in our 
poor finite measure, as intense as His infinite love and 
bounty? (Father Russell s "Communion Day.") 

DEVOUT EXERCISES FOR ALL THE THURSDAYS IN THE YEAR, 
AND ESPECIALLY FOR HOLY THURSDAY AND THE FEAST 
OF CORPUS CHRISTI. 

E Sovereign Pontiff, Pius VII., on Feb. 14, 1815, and 
April 6, 1 8 1 6, granted : a plenary indulgence to all those 
who shall perform for one hour, in public or in private, on 
Holy Thursday, any devout exercise in honor of the insti 
tution of the Blessed Sacrament, provided that they be 
truly penitent, and approach the sacraments of confes 
sion and communion on that day, or on any day .during the 
following week. 

A plenary indulgence, on the same conditions, on the 

* Henry James Coleridge, S.J. 



and (fie Sacred Heart. 605 

Feast of Corpus Christi. An indulgence of 300 days for 
each of the other Thursdays of the year, on performing the 
said exercise with at least contrite heart and devotion. All 
these indulgences were confirmed by the Sovereign Pontiff, 
Pius IX., June 1 8, .1876. 

EMMANUEL.* 

" His name shall be called Emmanuel, which, being inter 
preted, is God with us" (Is. vii. 14; Matt. i. 23). 

HAT would this world of ours be without the 
Blessed Sacrament? How bleak and desolate 
the earth, if it were not for the living humanity of Our 
Lord present in our midst! I often think that those who 
are outside the Church, and debarred from the bodily pres 
ence of Jesus on earth, are somewhat in the plight of the 
lost souls, who are debarred from the sight of the divine 
Essence in the other world. In a sad state, indeed, are 
those poor souls who know not that Jesus is on earth, that 
He is near them, in the same town with them, next door to 
them, and passes by them on the streets. And if they hear 
it, they will not believe it; just as the Jews did not believe it 
when He Himself told them (John vi.) . They do not under 
stand their loss. Jesus is, or at least should be, our life, 
our joy, and our great desire. Our disposition here and now 
should be to rejoice and exult that He is present in the 
Blessed Sacrament, to thank Him all the day long and to 
find our happiness and consolation in staying before the 
altar; having only one further desire, the blessedness of 
beholding Him with our eyes face to face. But that is 
too great a thing for this mortal, temporary existence, 
where all is yet dark and imperfect, and we live in the faint 
twilight of dawn (for that is what this world is), and not 
in the full blaze of the heavenly noonday. That we must 
long for and pray for to come in the future ; then, in heaven 
we will behold Him face to face. This desire is expressed 
in that verse in the Canticles, where the soul, still seeing 
in a glass darkly, says to the Beloved, "Show me, O Thou 
Whom my soul loveth, where Thou feedest, where Thou 
liest in the mid-day" that is, she desires to behold Him 
face to face, in the full light of heaven. But now she must 
be content with the presence of her Beloved in the dark, 
as it were, where she cannot see His human form, but, never 
theless, knows well that she has His humanity here, in the 

* Adapted from "The Little Grain of Wheat." 



606 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

Blessed Sacrament, where He lives and feeds among pure 
souls; and so she says again, in the words of the Canticles: 
My Beloved to me and I to Him, Who feedeth among 
the lilies, until the day break and the shadows flee away." 

So we should find our delight in Our Lord s presence with 
us in the darkness of this life ; and we should be very grate 
ful that He has not left us alone in the darkness. If we 
greatly love and desire Him, we will greatly love His sacra 
mental presence, that is, if we have a vivid, lively faith. 
And faith and love go together. 

Our Lord is not in the Blessed Sacrament as dead or asleep, 
nor simply there to receive your love and adoration. But 
just as the most blessed Virgin had her divine Son s life, 
and His holy examples, and actions, and w r ords going on 
before her eyes, to her inconceivable advancement in grace 
and spiritual progress, even so we have her Son s life and 
example going on before our eyes, in all their stages, which 
we can study to our immense profit and advancement in 
grace. The life of our dear Lord in the divine Host is most 
active. He remains still in the tabernacle, it is true, but 
graces are flying forth from His Heart in inconceivable 
abundance. 

From the tabernacle Our Lord works miracles both on 
souls and bodies, as He did of old in Galilee and Judea. 

Our divine Lord, thus present in this Sacrament of His 
love, is the central object of the devotion and worship of 
the holy Catholic Church. From His Sacred Heart, present 
in the tabernacle, go forth streams of grace upon human souls, 
that lift them up in prayer and adoration to the throne of 
God. Ask yourselves whence comes the sense of awe with 
which even the least devout of us is filled when we enter 
a Catholic church? We feel ourselves, when we know that 
our divine Lord is present, in a spirit of prayer that lifts 
our souls up to God. That is what distinguishes the hum 
blest Catholic church from heretical places of worship. It 
is the house and the very home of God. The very words 
we use, "a visit to the Blessed Sacrament," reminds us that 
we go to a living person, and that He is no other than our 
blessed Saviour, Who deigns to dwell amongst us that He may 
draw us to Himself and pour out His grace upon us. 

And how wonderfully is this gracious purpose of His 
mercy fulfilled! How many human souls are daily raised 
by this adorable Presence above the cares and interests, 
and sorrows and pleasures of life to the thought of God, 
and all that His service imports! If we could only see 
brought all together the acts of adoration, and love, and 



and the Sacred Heart. 607 

thanksgiving, and resignation, and the outpourings of human 
hearts that go to make up the service of God on earth, that 
are daily and hourly drawn out of them in every quarter 
of the world by this Adorable Sacrament, we should then 
understand something of the way in which it fulfils the loving 
design of its institution. 

Before the tabernacle great saints have communed with 
God upon the heights which we may never reach; there, 
too, sinners have come, and, touched by the grace that 
goes out from Him, found the contrite and humble heart 
which He will never despise. Think of the millions of the 
ordinary faithful who, day by day, or at least from time to 
time, come into the house of God to pray, and even for a 
moment catch a glimpse of holy things, arid carry the memory 
of it like a saving influence back into their ordinary avoca 
tions; think of the countless Religious nuns and monks 
to whom this presence is as the air they breathe, the very 
life and sustenance of their souls. No one shall ever know 
all that this Adorable Sacrament is for human souls; but 
we do know that in countless ways, ceaselessly, according 
to the multitudinous mercies of the Sacred Heart, it is work 
ing upon us converting the sinner, making perfect the 
saint, keeping the ordinary Christian in the way of God s 
commandments, raising all our hearts to that one Heart which 
is the center and source of grace and love. 

We should, then, try to cultivate in ourselves the spirit 
of devotion to our blessed Lord in the Holy Eucharist. 

He is with us in the Blessed Sacrament as a consequence 
of the Resurrection and Ascension; and His sacramental 
presence is a constant reminder of those happy mysteries. 
He is in the same actual state now, in the tabernacle, that 
He was in on the morning of the Resurrection, and when 
He was parted from His apostles on His Ascension day. He 
comes to us from the glory of heaven, fresh from the bosom 
of His Father, full of beauty, blessedness, and joy, full of 
the new wine of His Father s love, crowned and sceptered, 
and Sovereign of the kingdom of God, and desiring to con 
fer all this blessedness, glory, and royalty on all who will 
open to Him their hearts. Blessed are we, who have Him 
with us night and day! In Him we have all we want; for 
in the Holy Eucharist He gives us all He ever was, and is, 
and is to be. "Blessed are the eyes which see the things 
that you see; for I say to you that many prophets and 
kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have 
not seen them; and to hear the things that you hear, and 
have not heard them" (Luke x. 23). 



608 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 



LOOKING THROUGH THE LATTICES.* 

" ^TT^EHOLD He standeth behind our wall." But tbe barrier 
fi&amp; between Our Lord in His veiled presence and our 
selves is not a drawback, an obstacle to union with Him 
inseparable indeed from the present condition of things 
yet an obstacle for all that. It is distinctly willed by Him 
as a necessary part of our trial, a wholesome discipline, 
a purification of love. It has in it all the privileges, advan 
tages, blessings, that in this life belong to pain, and can 
be won by pain alone. It is a present blessing as well as 
a pledge of blessing to come. "Blessed are they that have 
not seen and have believed" (John xx.). It is a pledge of 
that full clear vision, "reserved in heaven for you, who, 
by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, 
ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein you shall 
greatly rejoice, if now for a little time you must be made 
sorrowful. . . . That the trial of your faith (much more 
precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found 
unto praise and glory and honor at the appearing of Jesus 
Christ: Whom having not seen, you love; in Whom also 
now, though you see Him not, you believe, and believing 
shall rejoice with joy unspeakable" (i Pet. i.). 

"We see now through a glass in a dark manner: but then 
face to face" (i Cor. xiii.). "I shall see Him, but not now" 
(Num. xxiv., 17). How will that face to face vision be 
the brighter and the sweeter for the dimness now! How 
will the joy of that moment, when we part for ever with faith 
be intensified by what faith has cost us in the past! 

But meanwhile the Beloved is behind the wall. And He 
is there with all the sympathy for our difficulty which His 
perfect knowledge of it enables Him to have. "Jesus 
needed not that any man should tell Him for He knew what 
was in man." He knows the weariness of praying on against 
apparently unanswered prayer; against the pain of physical 
restlessness, the labor of thought, the irksomeness of con 
centration, the perpetual gathering together of the forces 
that are playing truant in a thousand fields, recalled for a 
brief space only to be off again more wayward for their 
capture. All this He knows. And our remedy is to 
remember that He knows it. He Who has appointed 
prayer to be the channel of grace, means such prayer as 
we can bring Him. He does not ask impossibilities. He 
does not place us amid distracting work all day long and 

* Canticles ii. Q. 



and the Sacred Heart. 609 

expect us to shut it out by an effort of will the moment we 
kneel down to pray. Nor even to shut it out by repeated 
efforts. He would have us turn our distractions and weari 
ness not so much into matter for self-reproach, or humili 
ation even, as into a loving, trustful plea for His pity and His 
help. This is prayer. Lay the tired brain, the strained 
muscles, the aching head lay them all down at His feet 
without a word, just for His eye to rest on and His Heart 
to help and heal. 

There are times when physical lassitude, cold or heat, an 
importunate thought, a trial with its sting still fresh, baffles 
every effort to fix the mind on the subject of prayer, and con 
centrates the whole attention on what for the moment is 
all-absorbing. Times harder still to manage, when mind 
and heart are so absolutely vacant and callous that there 
is no rousing them to action. This reflection will some 
times be helpful then What should I have to say were I 
in the presence of the one I love best in the world; with 
whom I am quite at my ease; my friend par excellence; to 
whom my trials, difficulties, character, the secrets of my 
soul are known; that one in whose concerns and welfare 
I take the deepest interest ; whose plans and views are mine, 
discussed again and again together; in whose company time 
flies and the hour for parting comes too soon what should 
I find to say? 

Say it, make an effort to say it to Him Who is in the 
tabernacle yonder. 

O Jesus, hidden God, "more friendly than a brother" 
(Prov. xviii. 24), I believe most firmly that You are present, 
a few feet only from where I kneel. You are behind that 
little wall, listening for every word of confidence, and love, 
and thanksgiving, and praise. Listening when my heart 
is free to pour itself out to You as the brook to the river 
in the days of spring. Listening more tenderly when the 
stream is ice-bound; when I kneel before You troubled, 
wearied, anxious about many things, about many souls 
perhaps, yet dry and hard, without a word to say. Make 
my heart so perfectly at ease with You, O Lord, that it may 
be able to turn to You even in its coldness and inertness; 
to confide to You naturally all that most intimately con 
cerns it; to be content with this, when discontented with 
all else, with self most of all that You know all men "and 
need not that any should give testimony of man, for You 
know what is in man " (John ii.). Mother Mary Loyola.

fxwr of Booratfon. 

ONE of the methods for keeping the Hour of Adoration, 
recommended and explained by Pere Eymard in his 
beautiful work "La Presence R/elle," is that which corres 
ponds to the four ends of sacrifice. The Hour of Adoration 
is divided into four parts. During each quarter of an hour 
we are to honor Our Lord by one of the four ends oj sacrifice, 
i.e., by Adoration, Thanksgiving, Reparation, and Supplica 
tion. 

Meditation or Spiritual Reading and an Act of Spiritual 
Communion should also form part of the hour or half -hour 
of adoration. Litanies, Offices, Chaplets, suitable prayers 
and devout acts of various kinds are plentifully supplied 
in the following and other parts of this book for the use 
of the fervent Religious in her visits to Jesus, her divine 
Spouse, in the Sacrament of His love.

ACTS OF ADORATION THANKSGIVING, REPARATION AND SUP 
PLICATION. 

IN my moments before the tabernacle, I will try to obey 
the pious counsels contained in the Latin distich: 

" Crede, dole, spera, grates age, dilige, adora, 
Vulnera pande animae, donaque sancta pete." 

Believing all that God has in any way to d to us grieving 
for all my sins, offences, and negligences hoping in Thee, 

Lord, Who wilt never let me be confounded thanking 
Thee for this supreme gift, and for all the gifts of Thy good 
ness loving Thee, above all in this Sacrament of Thy love 
adoring Thee in this deepest mystery of Thy condescension: 

1 lay before Thee all the wounds and wants of my poor soul, 
and ask for all that I need and desire. But I need only 
Thyself, O Lord; I desire none but Thee Thy grace, and 
the grace to use well Thy graces, the possession of Thee 
by grace in this life, and the possession of Thee for ever in 
the eternal kingdom of Thy glory. Thus, day by day, espe 
cially during my moments before the tabernacle, I will, with 
God s help 



and the Sacred Heart. 6 n. 

" Believe, and grieve, and hope ; thank, love, adore, 
Show my soul s wounds, and holy gifts implore." 

There is no aspect of God s love for us which ought to 
affect our hearts more tenderly than the mere fact of His 
wishing to be loved by us; and there is no manifestation 
of that tenderness of the Sacred Heart more touching than 
the yearning to be remembered, expressed at many times 
and in many ways, but especially in the Eucharistic Do this 
in commemora ion of Me, which becomes at the altar even 
more simple and affecting, In Mei memoriam jacietis "In 
memory of Me." When such infinite and utterly incom 
prehensible love as mis has Omnipotence for the instru 
ment of its behests, how can any poor little creature of God 
whose sole dignity is that he has a heart to love Him how 
can he presume for one moment to discuss the limits of the 
possibilities of the divine condescension? Fr. Russell, S.J. 

MOMENTS BEFORE THE TABERNACLE. 

God, my Lord, in Thine own place, 
I kneel before Thy sacred face 
That face which once for me on high 
Hung white in death beneath the sky 
And hail Thee King and Lord and Love, 
My heaven on earth, my all above. 

O Love supreme, O Love divine, 
Who stoopest low to make me Thine. 

Jesus, God and Master, pent 
Within this gracious Sacrament! 

1 love Thee, praise Thee, thank and bless 
Thy Godhead in Thy lowliness. 

For me made low! For me the Lord 

Of heaven, the uncreated Word 

Of God, doth condescend to dwell 

By night and day within this cell. 

Oh! break, proud heart, such love to see 

Revealed in such humility. 

My God, my Jesus, Thou hast done 
All that Thou canst to make me one 
With Thine own self. What need I more ? 
What grace is left me to implore ? 
Bought with Thy blood, for me outpoured 
Fed with the body of my Lord! 



612 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

Yet, ah! my Jesus kind and meek 
One other grace I still must seek: 
That all this love and all this pain 
May not be felt and borne in vain, 
But that Thy love may win my love 
And make me Thine in heaven above.

AN ACT OF FAITH. 
(Father Ramitre, S.J.~) 

Q JESUS! my Lord, my God, and my all! I 
believe that Thou art in Thy living manhood 
as truly present here in the Blessed Sacrament as 
when Thou didst walk amidst men, and converse with 
them. Relying on Thy word, which shall not pass 
away, I believe that Thou art here, ever living to make 
intercession jor us. Here is Thy sacred body, which 
hung upon the cross; here is Thy soul, which was sor 
rowful unto death and agonized in the Garden of Olives 
on account of my sins; here are those sacred wounds 
made by the nails and spear; here are those eyes which 
looked with pity and love on the penitent Peter, now 
gazing into my heart, now raised to plead for me with 
the heavenly Father, here are those ears, which heard 
the cruel cry of the Jews: " Crucify Him," which listened 
so compassionately to all the ills of men, and which 
now are listening to me. Lord, I believe that here 
on the altar Thy wounded Heart is beating for love of 
me, and I recall Thy blessed words: "My Heart is so 
consumed with love for men, that it can no longer 
restrain the flames of its charity." Sweet words of 
Thine, O blessed Saviour! I believe that they are true, 
and true as regards myself. 



and the Sacred Heart. 613 



3n Slit of &amp;opc anti Confidence in 

(Fr. de la Colombiere.) 

GOD, I believe most firmly that Thou watchest 
over all who hope in Thee, and that we can 
want for nothing when we rely upon Thee in all 
things; therefore I am resolved for the future to 
have no anxieties, and to cast all my cares upon 
Thee. "In peace in the self -same I will sleep and I 
mil rest; for Thou, Lord, singularly hast settled me 
in hope." 

Men may deprive me of worldly goods and of honors; 
sickness may take from me my strength and the 
means of serving Thee; I may even lose Thy grace 
by sin; but my trust shall never leave me. I will 
preserve it to the last moment of my life, and the 
powers of hell shall seek in vain to wrest it from 
me. "In peace in the self -same I will sleep and I will 
rest." 

Let others seek happiness in their wealth, in their 
talents: let them trust to the purity of their lives, 
the severity of their mortifications, to the number 
of their good works, the fervor of their prayers; 
as for me, O my God, in my very confidence lies 
all my hope. "For Thou, Lord, singularly hast 
settled me in hope." This confidence can never be 
vain. "No one has hoped in the Lord and has been 
confounded." 

I am assured, therefore, of my eternal happiness, 
for I firmly hope for it, and all my hope is in Thee. 
"In Thee, Lord, have I hoped, let me never be con 
founded." 

I know, alas! I know but too well that I am frail 
and changeable; I know the power of temptation 
against the strongest virtue. I have seen stars fall 



6 14 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

from heaven, and pillars of the firmament totter- 
but these things alarm me not. While I hope in Thee 
I am sheltered from all misfortune, and I am sure 
that my trust shall endure, for I rely upon Thee to 
sustain this unfailing hope. 

Finally, I know that my confidence can not ex 
ceed Thy bounty, and that I shall never receive 
less than I have hoped for from Thee. Therefore 
I hope that Thou wilt sustain me against my evil 
inclinations; that Thou wilt protect me against the 
most furious assaults of the evil one, and that Thou 
wilt cause my weakness to triumph over my most 
powerful enemies. I hope that Thou wilt never 
cease to love me, and that I shall love Thee un 
ceasingly. "In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped let me 
never be confounded." 



AN ACT OF CHARITY. 

(Blessed Margaret Mary s Sentiments.} 

r\ GOOD and merciful Saviour, it is the desire of 
my heart to return Thee love for love. My 
greatest sorrow is that Thou art not loved by men, and , 
in particular, that my own heart is so cold, so selfish 
and ungrateful. Deeply sensible of my own weakness 
and poverty, I trust that Thy own grace will enable 
me to offer Thee an act of pure and sincere love. And 
I wish to offer Thee this act of love in reparation for 
the coldness and neglect that are shown to Thee by 
Thy creatures in the Sacrament of Thy love. O Jesus, 
my sovereign Good, I love Thee, not for the sake of 
the reward which Thou hast promised to those who 
love Thee, but purely for Thyself. I love Thee above 
all things that can be loved, above all pleasures, and 
in fine above myself and all that is not Thee, protest 
ing in presence of heaven and earth, that I will live and 



and the Sacred Hear I. 615 

die purely and simply in Thy holy love, and that if 
to love Thee thus I must be persecuted, tormented, 
and put to death, I am perfectly satisfied, and I will 
ever say with St. Paul: Nothing can separate me from 
the love of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ, which I 
love and will love eternally. O Jesus, supreme Master 
of all hearts, I love Thee, I adore Thee, I praise Thee, 
I thank Thee, because I am now all Thine own. Rule 
over me, and transform my soul into the likeness of 
Thyself, so that it may bless and glorify Thee for ever 
in the abode of the saints. (Adapted.) 

A PRAYER FOR A VISIT TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT. 

(Including all the Acts Recommended.) 

Lord and my God, I firmly believe that Thou art 
really present in the sacred Host. I adore Thee be 
neath the sacramental veil which Thou hast mercifully chosen 
in order to approach us. Permit me, O dearest Jesus, to 
render Thee my homage together with the angels who sur 
round Thy altar-throne. I believe that Thou dwellest on 
our altars not only to receive our humble adoration, but also 
to be the food of our souls, our sacrifice to the infinite majesty 
of the heavenly Father, our light in darkness, our counsel 
in doubt, our consolation in affliction, our strength in tempta 
tion, our solace in suffering, our joy in persecution, our 
friend in every need, our teacher in the school of perfection, 
our master and our model in striving to become saints. 

I am a poor sinner, but I Jtope in that boundless mercy 
which detains Thee a prisoner of love in the tabernacle. I 
come to Thee with a contrite heart, and I beg Thy pardon 
and mercy. Thou art truly called the "Lover of souls," 
for Thou hast sacrificed Thy life for our salvation; Thou 
hast said: "My delights are to be with the children of men"; 
and Thy death-bed gift to us was the Holy Eucharist. I 
behold the tabernacle surmounted by a cross, and this re 
minds me, dear Lord and Saviour, that the Blessed Sacra 
ment is a memorial of Thy Passion and death. I love that 
infinite goodness which induced Thee to institute this Holy 
Sacrament of the altar, which is the grandest memorial of 



616 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

all Thy works, and in which Thou dost communicate Thy 
self so wonderfully to Thy creatures. I thank Thee for this 
sublime proof of Thy love, and ardently wish that I could 
worthily acknowledge all the blessings that I have ever re 
ceived from this fountain of grace and mercy. I sincerely 
regret that this precious pledge of Thy love is received by 
so many Christians with coldness and indifference. I wish 
to make amends for mv own ingratitude, and heartfelt atone 
ment for all those sinful acts of my life, by which I have 
wounded Thy loving Sacred Heart. I offer Thee my pro 
found adoration, my reparation, my sorrow and my love, tc 
appease and to rejoice, as much as l can, Thy Sacred Heart 
in this Sacrament of love for all the acts of irreverence 
profanation, and sacrilege which, to my shame, I may evei 
have committed, as well as for all those which have beer 
committed by others. I adore Thee, my Lord and m&amp;gt; 
God, with all the strength I have- I love Thee with the 
fervor of my whole soul; I acknowledge Thee as my only 
Master; I offer Thee all that I have, and all that I am. Jesus! 
I give Thee my heart with all its affections; I give Thee my 
soul with all its powers; I give Thee my body with all its 
senses. Jesus! I consecrate myself entirely to Thee; I wish 
to live and labor and sutler and die for the love of Thee. I 
abandon myself to Thee. Give me but Thy love and Thy 
grace, then my heart will be satisfied, and I will ask for nothing 
more. Thy kingdom come Thy will be done! I desire to 
adore and love Thee now and always, not only to supply 
the defect of those Catholics who do not adore and love Thee, 
but also for the conversion of heretics, schismatics, atheists, 
blasphemers, Jews, and idolaters. O silent Dweller in the 
tabernacle, Thou art, indeed, a hidden God! here Thou art 
still the Victim of the cross! As I gaze upon the sacred Host, 
I recall that pathetic word of Thine, O Lord, at the Last 
Supper: "Do this in commemoration of Me" "Remember 
Me! Yes, the Blessed Sacrament is a memorial of the 
" Man of sorrows," a memorial of the greatest pain a creature 
on earth ever endured, a memorial of the most tender, most 
constant, most unse fish and most heroic love the world shall 
ever know the last sweet gift of a Heart that fears to be 
forgotten. Oh, yes! Lord, I shall remember Thee. How 
could I forget Thy love, dearest Jesus! Mayest Thou be 



and the Sacred Heart. . 617 

known, adored, and loved by all, and may thanks be con 
tinually given to Thee in the Most Holy and Most Adorable 
Sacrament. Amen. 

PRAYER OF ST. ALPHONSUS LIGUORI FOR A VISIT TO THE 
BLESSED SACRAMENT. 

T- ORD Jesus Christ, Who, through the love which Thou 
r * bearest to men, dost remain with them day and night 
in this Sacrament, full of mercy and of love, expecting, invit 
ing, and receiving all who come to visit Thee, I believe that 
Thou art present in the Sacrament of the altar. From the 
abyss of my nothingness I adore Thee, and I thank Thee 
for all the favors which Thou hast bestowed upon me, par 
ticularly for having given me Thyself in this Sacrament, for 
having given me for my advocate Thy most holy Mother, 
Mary, and for having called me to vish Thee in this church. 

I this day salute Thy most loving Heart, and I wish to 
salute it for three ends: first, in thanksgiving for this great 
gift; secondly, in compensation for all the injuries Thou 
hast received from Thy enemies in this Sacrament; thirdly, 
I wish by this visit, to adore Thee in all places in which Thou 
art least honored and most abandoned in the Holy Sacra 
ment. My Jesus, I love Thee with my whole heart. I am 
sorry for having hitherto offended Thine infinite goodness. I 
purpose, with the assistance of Thy grace, never more to 
offend Thee; and. at this momen;, miserable as I am, I con 
secrate my whole being to Thee. I give Thee my entire 
will, all my affections and desires, and all that I have. From 
this day forward, do what Thou wilt with me, and with 
whatever belongs to me. I ask and desire only Thy holy 
love, the gift of final perseverance, and the perfect accom 
plishment of Thy will. I recommend to Thee the souls in 
purgatory, particularly those who were most devoted to 
the Blessed Sacrament and to most holy Mary; and I also 
recommend to Thee all poor sinners. Finally, my dear 
Saviour, I unite all my affections with the affections of Thy 
most loving Heart; and, thus united, I offer them to Thy 
Eternal Father, and I entreat Him, in Thy name, and for 
Thy sake, to accept them.

Sentiments of a TReligious before tbe JBlessefc 
Sacrament.* 

How have I deserved this happy lot? 

BEHOLD me in Thy presence, O my Jesus! Hidden 
in the Sacrament, Thou art the self-same Jesus Who 
for me didst sacrifice Thyself on the cross. Thou art He 
Who lovest me so much, and Who hast therefore confined 
Thyself in this prison of love. Amongst so many who have 
offended Thee less than I, and who have loved Thee better 
than I, Thou hast chosen me, in Thy goodness, to keep 
Thee company in this house, where, having drawn me from 
the midst of the world, Thou hast destined me always 
to live united with Thee, and afterwards to have me nigh 
unto Thee to praise and to love Thee in Thy eternal king 
dom. O Lord! I thank Thee. Horw have I deserved this 
haf&amp;gt;py lot? Happy indeed am I, O my Jesus! for having left 
the world; and it is my great desire to perform the vilest 
office in Thy house rather than dwell in the proudest royal 
palaces of men. Receive me, then, O Lord! to stay with 
Thee all my life long; do not chase me away, as I deserve. 
Be pleased to allow that, among the many pious souls who 
serve Thee in this house, I, though I am a miserable sinner, 
may serve Thee also. Many years have I lived far from Thee. 
But now that Thou hast enlightened me to know the vanity 
of the world, and my own foolishness, I will not depart 
any more from Thy feet, O my Jesus! Thy sacramental 
presence shall animate me to fight when I am tempted. 
Dwelling so near to Thee, I shall be reminded of the obli-

gation I am under to love Thee, and always have recourse 
to Thee in my combats against hell. I will always keep near 
to Thee. I love Thee, O my God ! hidden in this Sacrament. 
Thou, for the love of me, remainest always on this altar. 
I, for the love of Thee, will always remain in Thy presence 
as much as I shall be able. There enclosed Thou always 
lovest me, and here enclosed I will always love Thee. Always, 
then, O my Jesus, my Love, my all! shall we remain to 
gether, in time in this house, and during eternity in para 
dise. This is my hope, so may it be. Most holy Mary, 
obtain for me a great love for the Most Holy Sacrament. 

Let us be always united ; let us never more be separated. 

OMY Jesus, this is what I seek of Thee, and what I will 
always ask of Thee in holy communion: "Let us be 
always united; let us never more be separated." I know that 
Thou wilt not abandon me. Thou art so good and merciful. 
But I fear my own weaknesses, O my blessed Redeemer. 
"Suffer me not to be separated from Thee by sin!" As long 
as I am alive I am in danger from the enemies of my soul. 
Oh, through the merits of Thy Passion and death, I beseech 
Thee let me die, rather than commit a mortal sin. I repea t 
it, and pray Thee to grant me the grace always to repeat : 
"Suffer me not to be separated from Thee!" O God of my 
soul, my Lord and my all, I love Thee, I love Thee alone, 
and I will always love Thee! I desire but Thy love and 
Thy grace. May I be ever faithful to my vows. May I 
ever live according to the spirit of our Holy Rule. May 
I ever follow Thy example of humility, purity, obedience, 
poverty, and conformity to the will of our heavenly Father. 
Mary, dear Mother, pray for me, that I may love Jesus more 
and more and praise Him for ever with Thee in heaven.

AN APPROPRIATE PRAYER TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT FOR 
THURSDAY. 

OMOST adorable Jesus, merciful Saviour, Victim of 
love upon our altars, receive, I beseech Thee, my 
profound adoration. T firmly believe that Thou art really 
present in the Holy Eucharist where Thou mercifully hid st 
the splendor of Thy Majesty, lest it should deter us from 
approaching Thy sanctuary I believe that Thou art as 
powerful, as amiable and as adorable under the sacramental 



620 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

veils as Thou art in heaven. I believe Thou dwellest on our 
altars, not alone to receive our adorations, but to listen to 
our petitions to remedy our evils to be the strength and 
nourishment of our souls, our powerful Helper, our Refuge, 
and our Sacrifice. I hope in that boundless mercy which 
detains Thee among us poor weak sinners. I love that 
infinite goodness which induces Thee to communicate Thy 
self so liberally and so wonderful 1 } to Thy creatures. I thank 
Thee for this marvelous proof of Thy love, and ardently 
wish that I could worthily acknowledge all the blessings I 
have ever received from this Fountain of grace and mercy. 
I sincerely regret that this precious pledge of Thy love is 
received with such coldness and indifference. Alas! I my 
self have too often wounded by my ingratitude Thy merciful 
Heart on this altar, and am more guilty than others because 
Thou hast not only granted me abundantly the general 
blessings which this Fountain of grace pours on the world, 
but Thou hast provided me with the most favorable oppor 
tunities of loving and adoring Thee in this august Mystery. 
Thou hast placed me close to Thy sanctuary, where I can 
visit Thee frequently, and daily assist at the holy sacrifice of 
the Mass. Ah! my good God! Thou deservest all the love 
that my heart is capable of feeling; therefore, I humbly 
consecrate to Thee all my affections, and firmly resolve 
from this moment to endeavor to imitate the respect, grati 
tude, and love which always distinguished those among 
Thy faithful servants who were specially devoted to the 
August Sacrament of the altar. Accept, O divine Jesus! 
the adorable sacrifice of the Mass, and all the thoughts, 
words, actions, and sufferings of this day, which I fervently 
offer in thanksgiving for the institution of this sublime Mys 
tery; in atonement for all the insults, irreverences, and sac 
rileges which have ever been committed against it; and to 
implore for myself, for all the faithful, and especially for 
priests and Religious a very fervent and fruitful devotion 
to the Holy Eucharist. 

Grant me, through Thy divine Heart, a share in the pure 
and ardent love of the angels, who day and night surround 
the tabernacle, and of all the saints, who loved Thee most 
in this sacred Mystery of the altar, that I may serve Thee 
with purity of intention, with ardor and perseverance during 



and the Sacred Heart. 621 

my life, and enjoy Thee for ever in the splendor of Thy 
glory. Amen.

don for them all! O may I die, I beseech Thee, by Thy loving 
Heart, may I die rather than offend Thee, and may I live 
only to correspond to Thy love. 

Say the Our Father once, the Glory be to the Father five 
times; and then: 

O sweetest Heart of Jesus! I implore 
That I may ever love Thee more and more. 

2. My Jesus! I bless Thy most humble Heart; and I give 
thanks to Thee. Who, in making it my model, not only dost 
urge me with much pressing to imitate it, but, at the cost of 
so many humiliations, dost Thyself stoop to point me out 
the path and smooth for me the way to follow Thee. Foolish 
and ungrateful that I am, how have I wandered far away 
from Thee! Mercy, my Jesus, mercy! Away, hateful pride 
and love of worldly honor! With lowly heart I wish to fol ow 
Thee, my Jesus, through humiliations and the cross, and

thus to gain peace and salvation. Only be Thou at hand 
to strengthen me, and I will ever bless Thy Sacred Heart. 

Our Father once, Glory be to the Father five times. 

O sweetest Heart of Jesus, etc. 

3. My Jesus! I marvel at Thy most patient Heart, and I 
thank Thee for all those wondrous examples of unwearied 
patience which Thou didst leave me to guide me on my way. 
It grieves me that I have still to reproach myself with my 
extravagant delicacy, shrinking from the slightest pain. Oh, 
pour, then, into my heart, dear Jesus, eager and enduring 
love of suffering and of the cross, of mortification and of 
penance, that, following Thee to Calvary, I may with Thee 
attain the joys of paradise! 

Our Father once, Glory be to the Father five times. 

O sweetest Heart of Jesus, etc. 

4 Dear Jesus! at the sight of Thy most gentle Heart, I 
shudder to see how unlike mine is to Thine, since at a shadow, 
at a look, at a word of opposition, I fret and grieve. Oh, 
then, pardon my excesses, and give me grace that, in every 
contradiction, I may follow the example of Thy unchange 
able meekness, and so enjoy an everlasting holy peace 

Our Father once, Glory be to the Father five times. 
O sweetest Heart of Jesus, etc. 

5 Sing praise to Jesus for His most generous Heart, the 
Conqueror of death and hell; yet never wilt thou reach itj 
due with all thy praise. More than ever am I confounded, 
looking upon my coward heart, which, through human respect, 
dreads even a passing word. Courage, my soul! it shaH be 
so with thee no more. My Jesus, I pray Thee for such 
strength that, fighting and conquering on earth, I may one 
day rejoice triumphantly with Thee in heaven. 

Our Father once, Glory be to the Father five times. 
O sweetest Heart of Jesus, etc. 

Let us turn to Mary, consecrating ourselves to her more 
and more, and, trusting in her maternal heart, let us say 
to her: 

By the precious gifts of thy sweetest heart, obtain for me, 
great Mother of my God and my Mother Mary, a true and 
lasting devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, thy well-beloved 



and the Sacred Heart. 625 

Son, that, united in every thought and affection with that 
Heart, I may fulfil all the duties of my state of life with ready 
heart, serving my Jesus ever more, but especially on this day.

AN ACT OF REPARATION OF HONOR TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
IN THE BLESSED SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR. 



adorable Saviour, in Thy wondrous love for us 
Thou dost remain in the Blessed Sacrament of the 
altar, in order to be the perpetual Sacrifice of the New Law, 
the propitiatory Victim for our sins, the life-giving Manna 
of our souls, our powerful Mediator, our good Master, our 
best and kindest Friend 

But, alas! with what ingratitude on our part has Thine 
infinite goodness been repaid. Prostrate before Thy veiled 
majesty, at the foot of the altar, where Thou art as truly 
and really present as in heaven, we come to make reparation 
and offer atonement for all the injuries and for all the in 
gratitude inflicted on Thee in the Sacrament of Thy love. 

O divine Jesus, O meek* and humble Jesus, accept our 
feeble efforts to compassionate Thy suffering Heart, and to 



626 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

make a fitting reparation to Thy outraged majesty for all 
blasphemies, profanations, and sacrileges ever committed; 
for our own want of devotion and reverence in Thy sacred 
presence, for our poor preparations and thanksgivings at 
holy communion, and for the little fruit we have drawn from 
holy communion through our own fault. 

Pardon, O Lord, pardon, we beseech Thee, these and all 
our offences against Thee. We are truly sorry for having 
sinned, because Thou art infinitely good and sin displeases 
Thee. Thou wilt not despise a contrite and humble heart. 
We offer Thee our poor hearts filled with sentiments of 
sincere repentance and deep affection. We offer Thee, in 
atonement, Thy own bitter sufferings, the sorrows of Thy 
Blessed Mother, and the merits of all the saints. By the 
fervor of our love we desire to make amends to Thee for 
the injuries inflicted on Thee by ourselves, by infidels, here 
tics, and all negligent Christians. Yes, Jesus, we love Thee 
now above all things, and we are resolved to please Thee by 
doing Thy will and by faithfully discharging the obligations 
of our state of life. Thy kingd m come; Thy will be done 
on earth as it i&amp;gt; in heaven! 

How happy should we be, O Jesus, could we but make 
reparation to Thy glory-, by our respect, by our zeal, aye, 
even by the shedding of our blood. At least, most adorable 
Saviour, grant us the grace to love Thee in the Most Holy 
Sacrament of the altar, with the most tender, the most gener 
ous, the most perfect, the most constant love. 

O Sacrament most holy, O Sacrament divine, 

All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment Thine! 

Virgin most holy, by thy holy and immaculate heart, make 
us enter into the adorable Heart of thy divine Son, Jesus Christ. 
O sweet St. Joseph! obtain for us the gift of prayer and of 
jxrpetual union with Jesus and Mary. Amen. 

AN ACT OF REPARATION TO THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS 
FOR THE FIRST FRIDAY OF THE MONTH. 

DORABLE Heart of Jesus, glowing with love for us, 
, and inflamed with zeal -for our salvation: O Heart! 
ever sensible of our misery and the wretchedness to which 



and the Sacred Heart. 627 

our sins have reduced us, infinitely rich in mercy to heal the 
wounds of our souls, behold us humbly prostrate before 
thee to express the sorrow that fills our hearts for the cold 
ness and indifference with which we have so long requited 
the numberless benefits that thou hast conferred upon us. 
With a deep sense of the outrages that have been heaped 
upon thee by our sins and the sins of others, we come to 
make a solemn reparation of honor to thy most sacred 
majesty. It was our sins that overwhelmed Thy Heart with 
bitterness; it was the weight of our iniquities that pressed 
down Thy face to the earth in the Garden of Olives, and 
caused Thee to expire in anguish and agony on the cross. 
But now, repenting and sorrowful, we cast ourselves at Thy 
feet, and implore forgiveness. Adorable Heart of Jesus, 
source of true contrition and ever merciful to the penitent 
sinner, impart to our hearts the spirit of penance, and give 
to our eyes a fountain of tears, that we may sincerely bewail 
our sins now and for the rest of our days. Oh, would that 
we could blot them out, even with our blood! Pardon them, 
O Lord, in Thy mercy, and pardon and convert to Thee all 
that have committed irreverences and sacrileges against 
Thee in the Sacrament of Thy love, and thus give another 
proof that Thy mercy is above all Thy works. Divine Jesus, 
with Thee there are mercy and plentiful redemption; deliver 
us from our sins, accept the sincere desire we now entertain: 
and our holy resolution, relying on the assistance of Thy 
grace, henceforth to be faithful to Thee. And in order to 
repair the sins of ingratitude by which we have grieved Thy 
most tender and loving Heart, we are resolved in the future 
ever to love and honor Thee in the Most Adorable Sacra 
ment of the altar, where Thou art ever present to hear and 
grant our petitions, and to be the food and life of our souls. 
Be Thou, O compassionate Jesus! our Mediator with Thy 
heavenly Father, Whom we have so grievously offended, 
strengthen our weakness, confirm these, our resolutions of 
amendment, and as Thy Sacred Heart is our refuge and our 
hope when we have sinned, so may it be the strength and 
support of our repentance, that nothing in life or death may 
ever again separate us from Thee. Amen.

B I VINE Heart of my Jesus! I adore thee with all the 
powers of my soul; I consecrate them to thee for 
ever, with my thoughts, my words, my works, and my whole 
self. I purpose to offer to thee, as far as I can, acts of 
adoration, love, and glory like unto those which thou offerest 
to thine eternal Father. Be thou, I beseech thee, the re 
pairer of my transgressions, the protector of my life, my

refuge and asylum in the hour of my death. By thy sighs, 
and by that sea of bitterness in which thou wast plunged 
for me throughout thy whole mortal life, grant me true con 
trition for my sins, contempt of earthly things, a burning 
desire of eternal glory, trust in thy boundless merits, and 
final perseverance in thy grace. 

Heart of Jesus, all love! I offer thee these humble prayers 
ior myself and for all who unite with me in spirit to adore 
thee; vouchsafe out of thy great goodness to hear and 
answer them, chiefly for that one among us who first shall 
end this mortal life. Sweet Heart of Jesus! pour into his 
heart in his death agony thine inward consolations; take 
him within thy sacred wounds; cleanse him from all stains 
in that furnace of love, that so thou mayest soon open to 
him the gates of thy eternal glory, there to intercede with 
thee for all those who tarry in this land of exile. 

Holiest Heart of my most loving Jesus! f or _ myself, a 
wretched sinner, and for all who unite with me in adoring 
thee, I purpose to renew and offer to thee these acts of 
adoration and these prayers, at every moment, and to the 
last instant of my life. I recommend to Thee, my Jesus, 
the Church, Thy well-beloved Spouse, and our true Mother; 
the souls who are following the path of justice, poor sinners, 
the afflicted, the dying, all men on the whole face of the earth. 
Let not Thy blood be shed in vain for them; and vouchsafe, 
lastly, to apply it to the relief of the souls in purgatory, and, 
above all, to those who in life were wont to adore Thee devoutly. 

Most loving heart of Mary, which, amongst the hearts of 
all God s creatures, art at once the purest and the most in 
flamed with love for Jesus, and the most compassionate 
toward us, poor sinners! obtain for us from the Heart of 
Jesus, Our Redeemer, all the graces which we ask of thee. 
Mother of mercies, one throb, a single beat of thy burning 
heart, offered by thee to the Heart of Jesus, has power to 
console us to the full. Grant us then this favor; and then the 
Heart of Jesus, through the filial love He had for thee, and will 
ever have, will not fail to hear and answer our request. Amen. 

Indulgence of 300 days, once a day, to all the faithful who 
shall say these prayers, with the Our Father, the Hail Mary, and 
the Glory be to the Father, each three times; plenary indulgence 
once a month on usual conditions. Pius VII., Feb. 12, 1808; 
Pius IX., June 18, 1876. 



and the Sacred Heart. 631 



(Reparation ano Consecration for TReligious, 

J7ESUS, my Lord, in Thy presence I rejoice that I am 
J permitted to dwell in this holy house as one of Thy 
special friends; I thank Thee for the grace of my sublime 
vocation: I rejoice that I am privileged to bear the fetters of 
the religious vows, which bind me to Thee. How true are 
Thy words, divine Master: "My yoke is sweet, and My 
burden light." In sacrifice I find the sweetest joy, in Thy 
love the greatest consolation, and in Thy service that pea e 
which the world can not give. With the Royal Psalmist, I 
will sing Thy praises: 

"The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? 

"The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be 
afraid ? . . . 

"One thing I have asked of the Lord; this will I seek 
after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days 
of my life. 

"That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit 
His temple. 

"For He hath hid me in His tabernacle: in the day of 
evils, He hath protected me in the secret place of His taber 
nacle. 

"He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now He hath lifted 
up my head above my enemies. 

"I have offered a sacrifice of jubilation; I will sing a psalm 
to the Lord. 

"Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to Thee: 
1 ave mercy on me and hear me. 

"Turn not away Thy face from me: decline not in Thy 
wrath from Thy servant. 

"Be Thou my helper: forsake me not, do not Thou despise 
me, O God my Saviour. 

"For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord 
hath taken me up. 

"Set me, O Lord, a law in Thy way, and guide me in the 
right path, because of my enemies. . . ." (Ps. xxvi.) 

"Thou art my God, and I will praise Thee: Thou art my 
God, and I will exalt Thee. 

"I will praise Thee, because Thou hast heard me: and 
art become my salvation. 



632 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

"O praise ye the Lord, for He is good: for His mercy en 
dureth forever" (Ps. cxvii.). 

."I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God 
rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners; for better 
is one day in Thy courts above thousands " (Ps. Ixxxiii.). 

I place myself unreservedly in Thy hands, O Lord, to do 
with me what Thou pleasest. I desire but Thy love and 
Thy grace; I desire to love and please Thee alone. Glory 
and praise to Thee for evermore. How good and kind Thou 
art to us in the Sacrament of Thy love! Thou art indeed 
our hope, our support, our consolation, our joy, our very 
life in the daily routine of our duties. And yet even in Re 
ligious Houses, Thou dost sometimes suffer from the cold 
ness and neglect of Thy chosen and highly favored friends. 
Pardon us, O Lord, pardon our offences, in Thy mercy. 
Surely we all love Thee sincerely and above all things, even 
though at times, like thoughtless children, we have given 
Thee pain. Pardon our carelessness, our want of devotion 
and recollection, our irreverences and all our shortcomings 
at Mass, at holy communion, and in Thy adorable presence. 
Behold me prostrate before Thee and desiring to make Thee 
a worthy reparation for all the indignities that have been 
offered Thee in this house. 

In my weakness and poverty I have nothing that I can 
offer Thee by way of reparation for the offences committed 
against Thee in the Sacrament of the altar. But in Thy infinite 
goodness and love, Thou art content with a contrite and 
humble heart. Take my heart, dear Jesus; take all that 
I am and have; grant that I may love Thee and please Thee 
daily more and more, by cultivating the spirit of my vows, by 
greater fidelity to my holy Rule, by imitating Thy example 
of humility and obedience, and thus arrive at that perfection 
for which Thou hast destined me. 

AN ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS. 

O ADORABLE Heart of Jesus, the tenderest, the most 
amiable, the most generous of all hearts! penetrated 
with gratitude at sight of thy benefits, I come to conse 
crate myself wholly and unreservedly to thee! I wish to 
devote all my energies to propagating thy worship and win 
ning, if possible, all hearts to thee. Receive my heart this 



and the Sacred Heart. 633 

day, O Jesus! or rather take it and change it, purify it, to 
render it worthy of Thee; make it humble, obedient, gentle, 
patient, faithful, and generous like Thine, by inflaming it 
with the fire of Thy love. Hide it in Thy divine Heart 
with all the hearts which love Thee, and are consecrated to 
Thee; never permit me to take my heart from Thee again. 
Ah! let me rather die than ever grieve Thy Adorable Heart. 
Yes, Heart of Jesus, to always love thee, to honor thee, 
to serve thee, to ever be wholly thine is the desire of my 
heart for life, for death, and for all eternity. Amen. 

Renovation of Wows for IReliflioue persons. 

(By Rev. Father de la Colombiere, S.J.) 

MY amiable Redeemer! I give and consecrate 
myself to Thy Sacred Heart in the most per 
fect manner of which I am capable. 

I have in a manner nailed myself to Thy cross by 
ihe vows of my profession; I renew them in this divine 
Heart, in the presence of heaven and earth. I return 
Thee thanks for having inspired me to make them. 

I own that the yoke of Thy holy service is neither 
hard nor weighty; I do not find myself embarrassed 
with my chains; on the contrary, I would wish to mul 
tiply them, or rivet them yet closer upon me. 

I embrace, then, the dear cross of my vocation, even 
to my death; it shall be all my pleasure, all my glory 
and my delight. 

God forbid that I should glory, that I should ever 
rejoice, save in the cross of Jesus Christ. 

God forbid that I should ever have any other treasure 
than His poverty, any other delight than His sufferings, 
any other love than Himself. 

No, no, my amiable Lord, never will I separate my 
self from Thee. 

I hope, then, O Lord! that Thou wilt render me 
steadfast under all temptations, victorious against the 
assaults of my enemies, and that Thou wilt stretch out 
over me that beneficent hand which has bestowed 



634 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

upon me so many favors, that I may be ever more 
and more generous in my love of Thee. 

I entreat this of Thee, O my adorable Jesus! by Thy 
blood, by all Thy wounds, and by Thy Sacred Heart. 

Grant that by the consecration which I make .to 
Thee of all that I am, I may become this day a new 
production and a complete victim of Thy love.

Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us. 
Jesus, victim! I wish to console Thee; 
To unite myself with Thee; 
To immolate myself with Thee; 
To annihilate myself before Thee; 
To forget myself to think of Thee; 
To be forgotten and despised for love .- f Thee 
Not to be loved or understood save only by Thee; 
1 will be silent to listen to Thee 
I will leave myself, to lose myself in Thee. 
Grant that I may thus quench Thy thirst, the thirst for

offer Thee a pure and true love. 

I will no longer weary Thy patience; take me, I give my 
self to Thee.

II. 

Consecration. 

JVESUS! adorable Saviour, hidden in the Sacrament of 
J Thy love, dwelling amongst us to sweeten our exile, 
shall I not exert myself to console Thine? Shall I not offer 
Thee my heart, since Thou hast given me Thine? It is 
true that to give myself to Thee is for my own advantage; 
it is to find the inestimable treasure of a loving, disinterested, 
faithful Heart, such as I would wish my own to be. Thus I, 
who can give nothing, am always receiving. Lord, I can not 
rival Thee in generosity, but I love Thee; deign to accept 
my poor heart, and although it is worth nothing, still it may 
become something by Thy grace. Since it loves Thee, do 
Thou make it good for something and keep it. Eucharistic 
Heart of Jesus! I consecrate to thee all the faculties of my 
soul, all the powers of my body. I wish to endeavor to know 
and love thee ever more and more, and to make thee better 
known and loved by others. I wish to labor only for thy 
glory, and to do only that which thy Father wills. I con 
secrate to thee all the moments of my life in a spirit of ado 
ration before thy royal presence; of thanksgiving for this 
incomparable gift; in reparation for our cruel indifference; 
and in incessant supplication that our prayers offered to 
thee, with thee, and in thee, may ascend purified and 
fruitful to the throne of God s mercy and for His eternal 
glory. Amen.

ACT OF ATONEMEN T. 

PfUCHARISTIC Heart of my God, breathing and pal- 
^~\ pitating beneath the veils of the most sacred sped s, 
I adore thee. Moved by a new love in the presence of the 
immense benefit of the Divine Eucharist, penetrated with 
regret at my own ingratitude, I humbly annihilate myself 
in the still greater abyss of thy mercies. Thou bast chosen 
me from my ; outh; thou hast not disdained my infirmity; 
descending into my poor heart, thou didst come to invite 
it to a mutual love, giving happiness and peace. And I lost 
all because I was unfaithful to Thee, O my Jesus. I allowed 
my mind to become distracted and my heart to become cold; 
I listened to myself and I forgot Thee. Thou didst wish 
to be my Guide, my Counsellor, the Protector of my life, 
and I, allowing my passions to smother this sweet attraction, 
lost sight of Thee and forgot Thee. In the salutary pains 
of trial, in the joys of consolation, in my difficulties and my 
necessities, instead of having recourse to Thee, I sought crea- 
tures and forgot Thee. I forgot Thee in the beloved taber 
nacles wherein Thy love languishes; in the churches of the 
city wherein Thou art insulted; in sacrilegious and indiffer 
ent hearts, and in my own guilty one, O Jesus, even before 
and after having received Thee. Eucharistic Heart of my 
Saviour, the delight of my first communion and during the 
days of my fidelity, I surrender myself to thee. Come back, 
come back, and draw me anew to thyself. Pardon me 
once more, and I will expiate all by the strength of my love. 
Glorious archangel St. Michael, and you, beloved St. John, 
offer my reparation to Jesus and be propitious to me. Amen. 
Indulgence of 200 days, once a day. Leo XIII., July 18, 1885. 

DAILY OFFERING TO THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS. 

/~\ LORD Jesus Christ, in union with that divine intention

to God through Thy most Sacred Heart, and which Thou 
dost still everywhere offer to Him in thj Holy Eucharist, 
even to the consummation of the world, I, in imitation of 
the most sacred heart of the ever-immaculate Virgin Mary, 
do most cheerfully offer to Thee, during this entire day, all

my thoughts and intentions, all my affections and desires, 
my words and all my works.

things and I desire to possess Thee within my soul. Since 
I am unable now to receive Thee sacramentally, come at 
least spiritually into my heart. I embrace Thee as being 
already there, and unite myself wholly to Thee; never, never 
permit me to be separated from Thee. 

2. Such an act of spiritual communion should be made 
at every visit to Jesus in the tabernacle; at holy Mass, when 
we do not receive the Sacrament; occasionally during the 
day or at least at morning and night prayers. The pious 
adorer should live in constant union with Jesus. 

3. St. Teresa was wont to say to her spiritual daughters: 
As often as ye hear holy Mass, although ye be unable to 
communicate sacramentally, you can make a spiritual com 
munion, which is of great value." The Council of Trent 
requires for a spiritual communion an ardent desire, lively 
faith, and fervent charity. How often shall we communicate 
spiritually? ^\s often as God inspires the holy desire, at 
any time, but especially at Mass, at Benediction, and at Visits. 
No particular form is required. We may use any form we 
please. With a contrite and a pure and loving heart, we 
may simply say: "Come, dearest Jesus, come into this my 
poor unhappy heart; come and satiate my longings; come 
and sanctify my soul; come, my sweetest Jesus, come." 

We read in the lives of some of the saints how Our Lord, 
to satisfy their burning desire to receive the Holy Eucharist, 
communicated Himself to them in miraculous ways as by 



638 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

going from the priest s hand to St. Catharine of Sienna, and 
to blessed Imelda, or piercing through the breast of St. Juli 
ana Falconieri, or as by the hands of angels or of His Blessed 
Mother to St. Bonaventure and St. Stanislaus. In various 
ways and by signal miracles, Jesus has manifested His appro 
bation of spiritual communion. 

ANOTHER PRAYER FOR SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

/T\Y Saviour and my God! I am not worthy to appear 
**** before Thee, for I am a poor sinner; yet I approach 
Thee with confidence in Thy goodness and mercy, for Thou 
hast said: "Come to Me, all you that labor and are heavy- 
laden, and I will refresh you." Thou wilt not despise a 
contrite and humble heart. I am truly sorry for my sins, 
because by them I have offended Thee, Who art infinitely 
good. Whatever may have been my foolish transgressions 
in the past, I love Thee now above all things, and with all 
my heart. I have a great desire, a vehement longing, O 
divine Spouse of my soul, to receive Thee in holy communion, 
and since I can not now receive Thee in the Blessed Sacra 
ment, I beseech Thee to come to me spiritually and to re 
fresh my soul with Thy sweetness. 

Come, my Lord, my God, and my all! Come to me, and 
let me never again be separated from Thee by sin. Teach 
me Thy blessed ways; help me with Thy grace to practice 
meekness, humility, charity, and all the virtues of Thy Sacred 
Heart. Receive me, as one who wishes to follow Thee, and 
let me live and labor and suffer and pray in union with Thee, 
for the glory of God, for the accomplishment of the heavenly 
Father s will, and for the salvation of souls. Jesus! I give 
Thee my heart with all its affections, my soul with all its 
powers, and my body with all its senses. My divine Master, 
help me with Thy grace, that I may be tver mindful of Thy 
presence, and that I may be faithful to the end in Thy ser 
vices. Bless me in life and in death, that I may praise Thee 
for ever in heaven. Amen. 

SIGHS TO JESUS IN THE BLESSED SACRAMENT. 

O JESUS, sweetest Love, come Thou to me; 
Come down in all Thy beauty unto me; 
Thou Who didst die for longing love of me; 
And never, never more depart from me. 



and ike Sacred Heart. 639 

Oh, melts my heart receiving Thee, my Own; 
My eyes are dim for lack of Thee, my Own; 
My flesh doth hunger, needing Thee, my Own; 
My soul doth faint apart from Thee, my Own. 

Free me, O beauteous God, from all but Thee; 
Sever the chain that holds me back from Thee; 
Call me, O tender Love, I cry to Thee ; 
Thou art my all! O bind me close to Thee. 

O suffering Love, that hast so loved me; 

O patient Love, that weariest not of me; 

Alone, O Love! Thou weariest not of me! , 

Ah! weary not till I am lost in Thee; 

Nay, weary not till I am found in Thee. 

Say the "Anima Christi." 



FRUIT OF THE VISIT AND SPIRITUAL COMMUNION. 

1. ^K&amp;gt; EHOLD Christ seated in thy heart as a kind Lord, 
f*ZJ Who hath made a friend of thee, His unworthy 

servant: regard thyself as a guest at His table, or rather as 
a hireling, since thou dost love Him when thou receivest con 
solation, but, when thou art scourged for thy good, dost grow 
cold in love. 

2. Love Him with thy whole strength, that so, in union 
with His strength and senses, thou mayest offer to God all 
the powers of thy soul, all the senses and members of thy 
body, and mayest resolve to use them always in obedience to 
Him. 

3. Ask thy Lord for the virtue of obedience; that thou 
mayest imitate Him Who for thy salvation humbled Him 
self and became "obedient unto death, even to the death of 
the cross" (Phil. ii. 8). 

"Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of Heart" 
(Matt. xi. 29). 

Ejaculation. 

Jesus, meek and humble of Heart, make my heart like 
unto Thine. 

Indulgence of 300 days, once a day. Pius IX., Jan. 25, 1868.

640 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

Let us pray. 

OGOD, Who in this wonderful Sacrament hast left us 
a memorial of Thy Passion; grant us the grace so 
to venerate the sacred mysteries of Thy body and blood, 
that we may ever feel within us the fruit of Thy redemp 
tion; Who livest and reignest world without end. Amen. 

Supplication, 

General and Special Prayers. 

PRAYER FOR THE GLORIFICATION OF THE BLESSED SACRA 
MENT AND FOR THE WANTS OF THE HOLY CHURCH. 

BATHER in heaven, Lord of mercy, we praise Thee and 
r-t-l thank Thee for the benefits that have come to us 
through the Blessed Eucharist. Thy infinite goodness sub 
stituted for the shadowy sacrifices of the Old Law, which 
could not satisfy Thee, this supreme Holocaust; and for 
the manna which of old poured down from heaven to nourish 
Thy first people in the desert, Thou givest to us the living 
flesh, the precious blood of the God-Man. This, His sacrifice, 
is daily offered on our altars; receive it, O Lord, as worthy 
of Thy greatness, and as the truest witness of Thy sovereignty ; 
receive it as the solemn thanksgiving for a world s redemption, 
and especially from that Church which Thou hast filled 
with blessings. Take it, dear Lord, as the infinite satisfac 
tion which appeases for the sins that have irritated Thy jus 
tice; and, above all, accept it as the most efficacious of all 
prayers whereby to obtain from Thy goodness the graces 
we need to sanctify our souls; for the exaltation of Thy holy 
Church, for the spread of Thy Gospel, and for the glory of 
Thy most holy name. Behold, O King of heaven and earth! 
the face of Thy Christ, immolated on Calvary for our sins; 
consider this dear object of Thy complacency disfigured on 
the cross, annihilated on the altar, hidden in the taber 
nacle, a Victim for the salvation of His people; and when 
Thou, O Lord, lookest upon this august spectacle, pardon 
our offences, grant us Thy protection, and receive us into 
Thy eternal kingdom. Thou didst perfect with infinite gifts 
His sacred humanity; for our sakes Thou didst enrich it with 
all grace, and didst constitute Him our Teacher, our High- 
Priest, our Mediator, the firm Rock of our salvation. To 
Thee He pleads for us, in Thy name He instructs us, He 



and the Sacred Heart. 641 

sacrifices Himself for our redemption. Oh! suffer the 
anger of Thy justice to be appeased by His powerful media 
tion, that it may obtain for us all the riches of Thy eternal love. 
Vindicate, O Father, the glory of Thy Son against sinners, 
and against the blasphemers of the Adorable Eucharist, as 
of old Thou didst declare Thine own. The innocent Lamb 
of God is as a sign of contradiction, against which the darts 
of infidels and heretics, of schismatics, of impious and wicked 
Christians, are maliciously cast. Too often He is a father 
forgotten by His own children, a monarch slighted by His 
subjects, a master abandoned by His disciples, a God dis 
honored by His creatures. But now grant, O eternal Father, 
that this Thy dearly beloved Son, to Whom we owe our all, 
may again receive His rights within the Eucharistic species, 
that all nations, all sects, returning into the bosom of the 
holy Catholic Church, may acknowledge Him, that therein 
all "minds and hearts may be subject to Him, and that this 
Divine Sacrament may receive respect, love, adoration, 
thanksgiving, and praise throughout the world. 

And for Thy holy Church, which glories in exalting the 
Blessed Sacrament and in extending its worship, we pray 
that the continual presence therein of her divine Saviour 
may perfect her; may it increase the faith, the hope, the 
charity of her living members; may it revive the faith and zeal 
of those who slumber, may it multiply her children, and be her 
defence against all her enemies. Bless, O my God, with 
Thy richest blessings, N., our chief bishop, the vicar of Thy 
Son here on earth, the visible head of His universal Church. 
Bless also the bishops and pastors of Thy Church, especially 
N., our prelate; all priests, and in particular the members 
of the "Eucharistic League" and of the "Apostleship of 
Prayer." Bless, O Lord, all Religious of both sexes, all 
Orders in Thy Church, all rulers, princes, magistrates, and 
all Thy people; grant that Thy Most Holy Sacrament may 
be to all the fountain of life, the treasure of grace, the ban 
quet of joy, and the throne of mercy. 

With Thy tender benediction, look, O Lord, upon the faith 
ful adorers of this Most August Sacrament, and deign to 
hear the vows, the prayers, the sighs, that day and night 
they offer for Thy glory, for the increase of love and venera 
tion for the mystery of the Eucharist. 



642 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

Finally, O my Lord and my God, I beseech Thee, by the 
merits of this thrice-holy Victim, to have mercy on the poor, 
the afflicted, the sick, and the agonizing. Relieve them all 
in their sufferings, console them in their afflictions, help them 
in their need, strengthen them in their weakness, animate 
them in their combats, and to the souls detained in purgatory, 
apply the blood of this adorable sacrifice; and, if it be Thy 
good pleasure, speedily deliver them from that painful prison, 
so that they may come to adore Thee and give Thee glory, 
with all Thy saints, eternally in heaven. 

PRAYERS FOR THE CHURCH AND FOR THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES. 

(Composed by Archbishop Carroll.) 

///"E pray Thee, O almighty and eternal God! Who 
VJcA through Jesus Christ hast revealed Thy glory to all 
nations, to preserve the works of Thy mercy, that Thy 
Church, being spread through the whole world, may con 
tinue with unchanging faith in the confession of Thy name 

We pray Thee, Who alone art good and holy, to endow 
with heavenly knowledge, sincere zeal, and sanctity of life, 
our chief bishop N.N., the vicar of Our Lord Jesus Christ 
in the government of His Church; our own bishop, N.R 
(or if he not be consecrated, our bishop-elect) ; all other 
bishops, prelates, and pastors of the Church; and especially 
those who are appointed to exercise amongst us the func 
tions of the holy ministry, and conduct Thy people into the 
ways of salvation. 

We pray Thee, O God of might, wisdom, and justice! 
through Whom authority is rightly administered, laws are 
enacted, and judgment decreed, assist with Thy holy spirit 
of counsel and fortitude, the President of the United 
States, that his administration may be conducted in righteous 
ness, and be eminently useful to Thy people over whom he 
presides ; by encouraging due respect for virtue and religion ; 
by a faithful execution of the laws in justice and mercy; 
and by restraining vice and immorality. Let the light of 
Thy divine wisdom direct the deliberations of Congress, and 
shine forth in all the proceedings and laws framed for our 
rule and government, so that they may tend to the preser 
vation of peace, the promotion of national happiness, the 
increase of industry, sobriety, and useful knowledge; and 
may perpetuate us to the blessing of equal liberty. 

We pray for his excellency, the Governor of this State, 
for the members of the Assembly, for all judges, mag ; strates, 



and the Sacred Heart. 643 

and other officers who are appointed to guard our political 
welfare, that they may be enabled, by Thy powerful pro 
tection, to discharge the duties of their respective stations 
with honesty and ability. 

We recommend likewise, to. Thy unbounded mercy, all 
our brethren and fellow citizens throughout the United 
States, that they may be blessed in the knowledge and sanc 
tified in the observance of Thy most holy law; that they 
may be preserved in union, and in that peace which the 
world can not give ; and after enjoying the blessings of this 
life, be admitted to those which are eternal. 

Finally, we pray to Thee, O Lord of mercy, to remember 
the souls of Thy servants departed who are gone before us 
with the sign of faith, and repose in the sleep of peace; the 
souls of our parents, relatives, and friends; of those who, 
when living, were members of this Congregation, and par 
ticularly of such as are lately deceased; of all benefactors 
who, by their donations or legacies to this church, witnessed 
their zeal for the decency of divine worship and proved 
their claim to our grateful and charitable remembrance. 
To these, O Lord, and to all that rest in Christ, grant, we 
beseech Thee, a place of refreshment, light, and everlast 
ing peace, through the same Jesus Christ, Our Lord and 
Saviour. Amen. 

A PRA-YER FOR ALL THINGS NEEDFUL, COMMONLY CALLED 
THE UNIVERSAL PRAYER. 

OMY God! I believe in Thee: do Thou strengthen my 
faith. All my hopes are in Thee: do Thou secure 
them. I love Thee: teach me to love Thee daily more 
and more. I am sorry that I have offended Thee: do Thou 
increase my sorrow. 

I adore Thee as my first beginning; I aspire after Thee 
as my last end. I give Thee thanks as my constant Bene 
factor; I call upon Thee as my sovereign Protector. 

Vouchsafe, O my God! to conduct me by Thy wisdom, 
to restrain me by Thy justice, to comfort me by Thy mercy, 
to defend me by Thy power. 

To Thee I desire to consecrate all my thoughts, words, 
actions, and sufferings; that henceforward I may think of 
Thee, speak of Thee, refer all my actions to Thy greater 
glory, and suffer willingly whatever Thou shalt appoint. 

Lord, I desire that in all things Thy will may be done, 
because it is Thy will, and in the manner that Thou wiliest. 

I beg of Thee to enlighten my understanding, to inflame 
my will, to purify my body, and to sanctify my soul. 



644 Thursday: T/ie Bccssed Sacrament 

Give me strength, O my God! to expiate my offences, 
to overcome my temptations, to subdue my passions, and 
to acquire the virtues proper for my state of life. 

Fill my heart with tender affection for Thy goodness 
hatred of my faults, love of my neighbor, and contempt of 
the world. 

May Thy grace help me to be submissive to my superiors 
condescending to my inferiors, faithful to my friends, and 
charitable to my enemies. 

Assist me to overcome sensuality by mortification, avarice 
by alms-deeds, anger by meekness, and tepidity by devotion. 

O my God! make me prudent in my undertakings, coura 
geous in dangers, patient in affliction, and humble in pros 
perity. 

Grant that I may be ever attentive at my prayers, tem 
perate at my meals, diligent in my employments, and con 
stant in my resolutions. 

Let my conscience be ever upright and pure, my exterior 
modest, my conversation edifying, and my comportment 
regular. 

Assist me, that I may continually labor to overcome 
nature, to correspond with Thy grace, to keep Thy com 
mandments, and to work out my salvation. 

Make me realize, , O my God ! the nothingness of this 
world, the greatness of heaven, the shortness of time, and 
the length of eternity. 

Grant that I may prepare for death; that I may fear 
Thy judgments, that I may escape hell, and in the end 
obtain heaven; through Jesus Christ my Lord. Amen. 

PRAYERS TO IMPLORE GRACES FOR OURSELVES, TOGETHER 
WITH ACTS OF ADMIRATION OF THE DIVINE GOODNESS. 

QY Lord and my God, how admirable in Thy goodness, 
how wonderful in Thy debasement and condescension 
art Thou in the Sacrament of Thy love! Thou, my Re 
deemer, Christ Jesus, art content to descend from heaven, 
to place Thyself within the consecrated Host, and to dwell 
within the tabernacle, day and night, solely to exercise 
Thy love toward me and to communicate to me the abun 
dance of Thy graces. Oh, what bounty, what mercy! In 
the Divine Sacrament, wherein dwells the Author and Giver 
of all good, I behold the King of glory, Who, with gentle 
courtesy, calls me, and invites me, and expects me, that I 
may go to receive His graces and be consoled. Courage, 
then, my soul; come, let us beg for blessings and not be 
weary, but be confident that we shall receive them. "Ltt 



and the Sacred Heart. 645 

us go, therefore, with confidence to the throne of grace, 
that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid" 
(Heb. iv. 1 6). 

If I look into my own heart to discover its needs that they 
may be supplied, I find that I am in want of all; for ail 
fails me, and I have no sound virtue, for vice alone pre 
dominates in me. My wants are without end, and Thou, 
my God, discernest them far more clearly than I can do. I 
am blind, and without light, and this is the first grace I 
ask of Thee: "Lord, that I may see" (I uke xviii. 41). 
Illuminate me, O true eternal Light, Who didst come into 
the world to enlighten every man; make me to see and to 
know my vileness, my poverty, my extreme misery, that 
knowing myself, I may learn humility. Want of humility 
is the great cause of my evil; I esteem myself too highly, 
and aspire to be highly esteemed by others; and hence I 
fall, and fall at every little occasion, without ever amend 
ing my faults All my sins are the effects, the punish 
ment of my pride. Oh, if I were but humble of heart, as I 
am under obligation to be! O my Jesus, Thou Who hast 
so abased Thyself in the Blessed Sacrament, almost to noth 
ing, and dost dwell there, hiding within the sacred Host all 
Thy glorious gifts, I ask of Thee a true and holy humility, 
for without this I have neither capacity nor disposition to 
receive any of Thy graces, and this alone can fit me for them. 
I ask it of Thee by that stupendous humility which brings 
Thee to dwell within the Blessed Sacrament O God of 
all greatness and of all humility, humble my pride and give 
me a humble and contrite heart. 

With the grace of humility I also ask of Thee ever to 
increase in me the graces of faith, hope, and charity. These 
virtues are of necessity for my salvation, and yet how negli 
gently does my heart make acts of them! How often do 
I allow a long time to pass without making so much as 
one act of faith, of hope, or of charity! O my Lord Jesus 
Christ! Who, in the Blessed Sacrament, hast deigned to 
leave us a mystery of faith, a pledge of hope, a bond of 
Jove, give me grace to acquire the good habit of frequently 
practicing these virtues during my life, that they may avail 
me in the hour of my death. Make me worthy to live and 
die in Thy faith, with a firm hope of living and dying in Thy 
love Give me, O Lord Jesus! an increase of faith, hope, 
and charity. 

But, besides" all this, O my God! I beseech Thee to give 
me grace to live in holy charity with all my neighbors. 
Thou hast commanded me to love them,, but I am neglectful 



646 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

in observing this law ; some among them I love from inclina 
tion, some from interest, and scarcely any purely for Thy 
love. I love him who treats me kindly, but I do not love 
him who offends me. Sometimes I intend to love all men, 
but I have too much reason to fear that in truth I do not 
love them with that Christian charity which is my duty. 
But Thou, in the institution of the Blessed Sacrament, hast 
left me a model, an example of charity; grant that by Thy 
grace I may imitate Thee. I resolve now to love all men 
sincerely and cordially for Thy sake, and particularly those 
who in any way have offended or injured me. All that I 
most desire for myself, I pray Thee to bestow on them, and 
to unite this my petition with Thine own prayer upon the 
cross, when Thou didst intercede for Thine enemies. Grant, 
dear Lord, that I may ever live in charity with all, that I 
may so live as never by any act of mine to break the bond 
of charity; that I may ever love my neighbor as Thou dost 
love me. Above all, I humbly beg of Thee the grace to live 
in all and through all, resigned to Thy all-holy will. I 
accept whatever Thy divine providence shall appoint in my 
life, and in my death; may Thy will in a!i things alone be 
done, not mine, O Lord! I desire all that Thou wiliest, 
and because Thou wiliest it ; and in all circumstances I unite 
my will to Thine. Therefore, O my dear Redeemer, I 
now and for ever unite my will to that adorable will which, 
in the garden, Thou didst, in perfect submission, offer to 
Thy eternal Father; and I beseech Thee ever so to retain 
my will in unison with Thine, that nothing shall again dis 
join them. Thou Thyself hast taught me to say, in the 
Pater Noster, "Thy will be done," and daily I repeat it, 
but too often I say the words only with my lips; now at 
least my heart pronounces them for all time, and in all pos 
sible occurrences "Thy will be done on earth as it is in 
heaven." To-day, and in all the days of my life, may Thy 
most holy will be done in me, for me, by me. Teach me 
to know Thy holy will, and give me grace to follow it. 

PETITION TO OBTAIN GRACES FOR OUR NEIGHBOR, AND 
PRAYERS FOR THE CHURCH, THE HOLY FATHER, PRELATES 
AND PRIESTS, SUPERIORS, PARENTS, BENEFACTORS, AND 
FRIENDS. 

T for myself alone do I implore graces, O my God, 
but for all the souls Thou hast redeemed with Thy 
most precious blood, and especially for all those who are 
within Thy holy Catholic Church, and chiefly for those who 



and the Sacred Heart. 647 

are zealous adorers of the Most Holy Sacrament of the altar 
For this, dear Lord, I recommend them to Thee with most 
tender affection. Give to us all one united, fervent spirit, 
zealous to prevent the offences committed against Thee, 
and ever active to promote devotion to Thy glory in the 
Blessed Sacrament. 

I commend to Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ, the holy 
Catholic Church; extend her bounds by the extirpation of 
heresy and the conversion of unbelievers. 

I commend to Thee His Holiness, the Pope, Thy vicar 
on earth, and I beseech Thee to assist him in discerning 
and doing all that is most conducive to Thy honor and 
glory. I commend to Thee all our bishops and our priests. 
Clothe them with Thy spirit Thy meekness, Thy humility, 
Thy obedience, Thy wisdom, Thy charity, and Thy zeal for 
the salvation of souls. Bless them in particular w T ith an 
ardent devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. I commend 
to Thee the members of all Religious Orders that they may 
labor earnestly for their own sanctification, for the propaga 
tion of the faith, and for the glorification of the Holy Eucha 
rist. 

I commend to Thee all civil authorities, but especially 
all Catholic heads of governments, that they may live in 
peace and that they may be united in zeal and strength 
against the enemies of our holy faith. I reqommend to 
Thee all sinners, for whose salvation Thou didst deign to 
become incarnate, to remain three-and-thirty years on earth 
and at last to die on the cross; and I beseech Thee to bestow 
upon them Thy powerful help, that they may repent and 
be converted, and may enter and remain in Thy holy grace. 
To Thee I commend my parents, my friends, my enemies, 
my superiors, spiritual and temporal, and all those to whom 
I am under obligation, and I beseech Thee to bless them, 
to give them grace to make a good use of their temporal 
goods, that* so they may obtain eternal happiness: "Ut sic 
transeamus per bona temporalia ut non amittamus aterna." 
"That we may so pass through temporal blessings, as not 
to lose those which are eternal." 

Finally, I recommend to Thy clemency the holy souls in 
purgatory, and especially those to whom I am most indebted 
by the bond of charity or of justice; and chiefly I implore 
Thee in behalf of those who, during their life, have been 
most devout to the Blessed Sacrament; as also those who 
have most loved the Blessed Virgin. For this I offer Thee 
my good Jesus, Thy wounds, Thy agony, Thy death, and 
all the merits of Thy most bitter Passion. I know that it 



648 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

is Thy pleasure I should pray for these holy souls, who are 
worthy of Thy love. Hear, then, dear Lord, and grant 
this my prayer in their behalf, which I present to Thee in 
the words of Thy holy Church: "Requiem ceternam dona eis, 
Domine, et lux perpctua luceat eis." "Eternal rest give 
unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon 
them."

FORM OF CONSECRATION TO THE SACRED HEART OF 

JESUS. 

Published with the Encyclical Letter of His Holiness 
Leo XIII., dated May 25, 1899, on the consecration of man 
kind to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. , 

(T\OST sweet Jesus, Redeemer of the human race, 
^^ look down upon us, humbly prostrate before 
Thy altar. We are Thine and Thine we wish to be; 
but to be more surely united with Thee, behold each 
one of us freely consecrates himself to-day to Thy most 
Sacred Heart. Many indeed have never known Thee; 
many, too, despising Thy precepts, have rejected Thee. 
Have mercy on them all, most merciful Jesus, and 
draw them to Thy Sacred Heart. Be Thou King, O 
Lord, not only of the faithful who have never forsaken 
Thee, but also of the prodigal children who have 
abandoned Thee: grant that they may quickly return 
to their Father s house, lest they die of wretchedness 
and hunger. Be Thou King of those who are deceived 
by erroneous opinions, or whom discord keeps aloof, 
and call them back to the harbor of truth and unity of 
faith, so that soon there may be but one flock and one 



and the Sacred Heart. 651 

Shepherd. Be Thou King also of all those who sit 
in the ancient superstition of the Gentiles, and refuse 
not Thou to deliver them out of darkness into the light 
and kingdom of God. Grant, O Lord, to Thy Church, 
assurance of freedom and immunity from harm; give 
peace and order to all nations, and make the earth 
resound from pole to pole with one cry: Praise to the 
Divine Heart that wrought our salvation ; to it be glory 
and honor for ever. Amen.

I. 

E Holy Hour is a pious exercise of mental or vocal 
prayer, in union with the prayer of Our Lord in the 
Garden of Olives on Maundy Thursday night. It was 
taught as a practice to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque, 
by Our Lord Himself, Who appeared to her while, she was 
adoring the Blessed Sacrament, and said: "Every night, 
between Thursday and Friday, I will make you partaker of 
that sorrow unto death which it was My will to suffer in 
the Garden of Olives. . . . To join with Me in the humble 
prayer which I then offered to My Father, you shall rise 
between eleven o clock and midnight ; you shall prostrate 
yourself with Me for one hour, with your face to the ground, 
both to appease the anger of God by imploring mercy for 
sinners, and to sweeten in some w r ay the bitterness I felt 
when My apostles abandoned Me, being unable to watch 
one hour with Me." 

In 1829, Father Debrosse, S.J., founded a confraternity 
in the chapel of the Jesuits at Paray-le-Monial, for the pur 
pose of spreading this devotion. In virtue of a rescript of 
Pius IX., issued in 1875, all the associates of the Apostleship 
of Prayer can gain the plenary indulgence for keeping the 
Holy Hour. The devotion may be practiced either in pub 
lic or in private ; if in public, then any hour may be named 
for any day in the week by the local directors; if in private, 
then the time is restricted to an hour, between 2 P.M. of 
every Thursday and about 6 P.M. on Friday. There are no 
special prayers or practices obligatory during the Holy Hour, 
but it should be offered in memory of the sacred Passion, 
and in particular of the prayer and agony of Our Saviour 
in the Garden of Gethsemane. 

No particular place is prescribed for keeping the Holy 
Hour; hence even sick persons can practice this beautiful 
devotion. To gain the plenary indulgence, the ordinary 
conditions of confession, communion, and prayer for the 
Pope s intention are obligatory. Independently of this, 
however, the pious exercise of the Holy Hour must be most 
meritorious and pleasing to Our Lord. We thereby make 
reparation to the Heart of Jesus for the ingratitude of men; 
participate in Our Saviour s agony; implore mercy for sin 
ners, and appease the anger of God.* 

* Lefevbre s "Month of the Sacred Heart," "The Watches 
of the Sacred Passion," by the Rev. P. Gallwey, S.J., and parts 



662 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

As to vocal prayers for the Holy Hour, there is an abun 
dance and a variety of them in this book, e.g., the Office of the 
Sacred Heart; the Litanies; the Acts of Consecration and 
Reparation, and the Prayers in reference to the Passion of 
Our Lord. The Rosary in honor of the sorrowful mysteries 
may also be recited.

REFLECTIONS, MEDITATIONS, AND PRAYERS FOR THE HOLY 
HOUR. 

VjTT no other time, perhaps, did the Heart of Jesus suffer 
(JPL more than during His agony in the Garden of Olives. 
And it is to this sad vigil that He calls us, gently chiding us 
as He reproached the sleeping disciples: "Can you not 
watch one hour with Me?" Oh, accept His loving invita 
tion! He will not refuse you powerful graces that will touch 
and even convert your sinful heart. 

Represent to yourself Our Lord Jesus Christ leaving the 
supper-room where He had just instituted the Sacrament 
of His love, and directing His steps toward the lonely garden 
where His Passion began, with the sorrow of His Sacred 
Heart. 

Imagine that, by a special favor the good Master chooses 
vou to be a witness of His agony and a companion in His 
blessed prayer. Hasten, therefore, with all the fervor c 
vour soul, to answer His loving call. 

" What a favor, O my Jesus! Thou invitest me to witness 
Thy agony and to realize the infinite love Thou bearest 
for sinners I follow Thee, O my Jesus, with readiness, and 
I desire to watch and pray with Thee during this hour. 
Thou knowest my weakness. Sustain me, therefore O Jesus, 
for without Thy assistance I shall be more cowardly than 
Thy apostles, and shall remain insensible to Thy sorrow 
and love. ,, . 

I come O my God infinitely holy, to prostrate myself, in 
union with Thy divine Son, before Thy supreme majesty, 

of Book II. and Book III. of Thomas a Kempis The Following 
of Christ" will serve very well for spiritual reading during the 
Holv Hour. Pious souls of every class, by using lather Ua^ 
wey s most admirable work, will feel their hearts burning with 
love of Him Who suffered for love of us all. 



and the Sacred Heart. 663 

and to annihilate myself in the presence of Thy infinite 
greatness. I come to offer Thee His agony and the sorrows 
of His Heart, to satisfy Thy justice. I come to weep for 
my sins and those of all men. Hear my supplications, and 
accept my homage, or rather cast Thine eyes on the Heart 
of Thy beloved Son, with whom I desire to be united during 
this prayer. 

Tlte First Prostration of Jesus. 

"He hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows." 

BEHOLD your divine Saviour prostrate, His face to the 
very ground, moaning under the weight of the iniqui 
ties of the whole world. He bore them; He took them on 
Himself; He offers to expiate them. Nevertheless, He 
feels so great a horror for them that He seems crushed and 
even annihilated under the weight of sorrow and humiliation. 

Adore profoundly this august and holy Victim. Beg Him 
to let you share His horror for sin, and to pierce your heart 
with holy and bitter sorrow. 

Recite with compunction of heart the Confiteor and an act 
of contrition. 

Behold the total abandonment in which our divine Saviour 
is found. A dread silence surrounds Him; His apostles 
are asleep; His Mother is far away; He is alone with His 
Father. But the Father, infinitely holy, no longer considers 
His divine Son as the object of His eternal complacency. 
He beholds in Him only the Victim upon Whom will fall His 
vengeance against sin. 

Repeat several invocations from the Litany of the Holy 
Name. Pronounce the name of Jesus with burning love. 
Oh, at what a dear rate the Son of God purchased this divine 
name! Now He suffers that He may indeed become Our 
Saviour, Our Jesus. 

Contemplate your Victim rising with difficulty and going 
to His disciples. He finds them asleep. Hear His gentle 
voice of reproach: " Could you not watch one hour with Me ? " 
Imagine that on returning to His place, Jesus directs His 
loving looks toward you. Cast yourself at His feet and 
say with loving heart : " O Jesus, I, too, have often abandoned 
Thee. I have afflicted Thy Heart by my wanderings, but 
now I return, to be faithful to Thee until death." 

The Second Prostration. 

SMAGINE you hear the sweet voice of your divine Saviour, 
exclaiming: "My soul is sorrowful even unto death." 
o swords pierced the Heart of Jesus the sword of His 



664 Thursday: The Blessed Sacrament 

love for His Father, and the sword of His love for men. He 
wished to repair the outrage done to His Father by sin; 
and yet sin will still be committed, and the majesty of the 
Father will again be insulted. He suffered to save men, 
to prevent them from falling into hell; and yet many will 
despise His goodness, and lose their souls despite His de- 
votedness and love. 

Keep the eyes of your soul fixed with love and compassion 
on your suffering Saviour. 

Contemplate His sacred head bowed to the earth. Behold 
the anguish of His adorable countenance. He sinks under 
the weight of so great an affliction. His agony begins. He 
seems about to die of sorrow. 

I et your heart be pierced with the sadness which hllea 
the Heart of Jesus, and reduced Him to this deplorable state. 
His blood flowing in vain for so many cherished souls! Hi; 
Father s goodness outraged by so many sins! Jesus scans 
the centuries and beholds me. He sees my little energy in 
overcoming myself, my infidelities, my ingratitude. Pene 
trated with grief for having contributed to the agony of 
Tesus let us say from our heaits: Behold, O my Jesus, this 
ungrateful soul who has been so deaf to Thy voice, who has, 
on a thousand occasions, despised the mercies of Thy ador 
able Heart. Weep no longer for me, O my amiable Jesus. 
I return to Thee ; I return for ever. Alas, my soul is loaded 
with miseries, stained with innumerable sins, but it belongs 
to Thee To possess it Thou consentest to suffer so much. 
O merciful Saviour, Thou hast said: Come to me, all ye that 
labor and I will refresh you. Here is my soul, O Jesus; it 
will be Thine for evermore. I come to share in Thy sorrow, 
and to console Thee by my sincere return. 

Animated with the desire of giving greater consolation 
to the Heart of Jesus, form acts of love, saying: 
neighbor as myself, etc. Promise Jesus that you will try to

Continue to contemplate your adorable Saviour delivered 
to agonies more cruel than death. He perseveres in prayer 
notwithstanding the weariness, fear, and sorrow that hll 
His Sacred Heart. Listen with profound respect to the 
praver of your Lord. Let it sink to the depth of your flinty 
heart Prostrate before your Saviour, unite in His senti 
ments Enter into His Heart, and repeat, with fervor, His 
divine prayer. Unreservedly offer yourself with Him to 
do the will of God.

means of arriving at perfection. Yes, I desire to imitate 
Thee in Thy divine resignation. On every occasion I will 
say: Thy will, O Father, Thy will, and not mine be done. 

Jesus goes again to His disciples and finds them still asleep. 

He returns, in sadness, to the place of His prayer. 

Tlie Third Prostration. 

OUR Saviour considers with intense anguish the suffering 
of His Passion, and His Sacred Heart endures them 
all. Oh, how great was the love necessary to accept them! 
In union with the Victim recall these sufferings, and first, 
the treacherous kiss of Judas. Ah, bitterly bewail your 
own baseness, in communions that were tepid, in those, 
perhaps, that were sacrilegious, in which you also gave the 
perjured kiss. Make an act of spiritual communion. Say 
three times, with the deepest contrition: Lord Jesus, my 
soul is not worthy to receive Thee. Say only the word and 
it shall be healed. Add in union with the angels surround 
ing the tabernacle : Lamb without spot, who art daily immo 
lated for the honor of God and the salvation of the world, 
be for ever blessed and glorified ! O good Shepherd, that 
Thou mightest remain with Thy cherished flock, Thou didst 
not fear to expose Thyself to all the outrages and profana 
tions of sinners. Be Thou for ever blessed and glorified! 
Saving Host, chalice of benediction, disarming the anger 
of God, be for ever blessed and glorified! 

The Heart of Jesus accepts the sentence of scourging. 
Already He feels the blows. His body is but one wound. 
His feet wade in His blood. The pillar to which He is 
attached is red with His blood, and shreds of His sacred 
flesh lie scattered around. Alas! by what cruel treatment 
Jesus wishes to expiate our sensuality and sloth, our vanity, 
but, above all, our faults against the lily of virtues purity. 

Follow the inspirations of your devotions, and form acts 
of contrition in union with all holy penitents. 

Jesus beholds the cross, the heavy cross prepared for Him 
to cany to the top of Calvary, and upon which He is to die, 
a Victim of divine justice and His infinite love for men. 
Oh, how painful, how crushing is the cross! Our sins have 
made it so heavy that Jesus can hardly carry it. Thrice 
on the way to Calvary He will fall, borne to the earth by 
its cruel weight. Nevertheless, He receives it and embraces 
it with holy ardor. Let us try to fathom this mystery of 
love. Jesus embraces the cross, because the cross will be 
our remedy, our strength, our salvation. Bless a thousand 
times your good God, Who has loved you to such excess. 



666 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

Promise Him that you will never again refuse the precious 
treasures He offers you when He deigns to give you a share 
in His cross. 

Repeat with tender and profound gratitude: We adore 
Thee, O Jesus, and bless Thee because by Thy holy cross 
Thou hast redeemed the world. 

Add with love and confidence: O Jesus, I wish to carry 
the cross with Thee. 

Jesus at length contemplates that last hour, which He 
calls His Hour, so great is His desire to finish the work of 
our redemption. Behold this hour of death in all its bitter 
ness. The Heart of Jesus feels all the sufferings prepared 
for Him. Stay with Him in His agony. He is stripped 
of His clothes; His hands and feet are pierced: He is raised 
on the cross, suspended between two thieves. He is insulted, 
abandoned by all. Listen to His dying words. Contem 
plate Him with love. Cry out from your heart: O Jesus, 
best of Masters and tenderest of Fathers, my heart feels a 
profound grief in considering the cruel sufferings Thou hast 
endured. Never, never again, shall anything separate me 
from Thee! Thou dost wish to shed even the last drop of 
Thy blood to expiate my many sins. Thy goodness touches 
my cold heart. O Jesus, I wish to be Thine during life till 
death. 

Repeat this prayer several times. Then add five times, 
in honor of the five wounds: Jesus, my Saviour, I will love 
Thee always, I will love Thee for ever. 

Recall to mind that Jesus, while thus considering the suffer 
ings of His Passion, feels them all in His Heart, and that 
His agony is increased by the crushing thought, God will 
again be offended; men will continue to cast themselves 
into the abyss of perdition. 

How bitter is this chalice presented to our divine Re 
deemer! His holy humanity is terrified, and again the cry 
of distress escapes from His blessed lips: Father, let the 
chalice pass from Me. 

In this awful moment an angel descends from heaven, 
and reverently raises Jesus. In company with this angel, 
approach your Saviour, and say to Him: "Wilt Thou, dear 
Lord, permit this poor soul to perish eternally?" And Jesus, 
with looks of tender pity cast upon you, will reply: "No, I 
will die willingly for you." Words can make no answer to 
such an excess of love. Let your heart alone speak to your 
Victim, with thanksgiving and gratitude inspired by the 
goodness of your most amiable Saviour. 

And Jesus being in an agony apd bloody sweat, prayed 



and the Sacred Heart. 66 7 

the longer. The more our infinitely compassionate Saviour 
suffers, the more He prays. Oh, how many and how great 
the graces showered upon the earth through the humility, 
the submission, the burning zeal which dictate the prayer 
of the God-Man. Ask with confidence for the blessings you 
most need. Pray for your parents, brethren, and friends, 
for your superiors, for your Order, for the Church. Pray 
with Jesus, like Jesus, through Jesus, and you will obtain all 
you desire. 

Recite five Our Fathers, and Five Hail Marys. 

Jesus arises, leaving the place dyed in the blood of His 
agony, of His martyrdom of love and superhuman courage, 
and goes to meet His cruel enemies. Follow Him in spirit, 
saying with all the love and energy of your soul : My beloved 
[esus, Thou art going to die for me: I wish to die for Thee. 

Jesus, no more during life will my heart be separated from 
Thee. 

Repeat the sacred words of the divine Victim: It is con 
summated. Apply them to yourself in saying: My* reso 
lution is taken. I renounce for ever all the sins and evil 
habits of my life which have caused so much suffering to my 
Saviour. I shall never again refuse anything to Him Who 
has so loved me as to deliver Himself for me. "Greater love 
than this no man hath, that he lay down his life for his 
friends." * 

Resolutions and Amendment. 

xTpvY sweetest Jesus, I here take the resolution of losing all 
vi^ rather than losing Thy grace. I am weak, but Thou 
art strong; Thy strength will render me strong against my 
enemies. Under Thy protection, what have I to fear? My 
sweetest Saviour, do not allow me to be separated from Thee. 
Assist me in the dangers in which I may find myself; may 

1 never fail in having recourse to Thee! I ardently desire 
to be faithful to Thee, and to live for Thee alone, so long 
as I may still remain on earth. It is for Thee to give me the 
strength of which I stand in need. 

Increase in me, oh, purest Heart of Jesus! the fear of dis 
pleasing thee. I tremble at tlr. sight of my past infidelities, 
but thy merits and the multiplied graces thou hast bestowed 
on me restore my confidence. Now that I love thee, I hope 
thou wilt not abandon me, and of this I feel assured in view 
of the mercy thou didst extend to me when I did not think 
of loving thee. I do not count on my own strength, for by 
experience I know how little it is worth. I depend entirely 

* From Spencer s "The Little Grain of Wheat." 



663 Thursday: t~Ke ffressea Sacrament 

on thy goodness and this is why I hope never more to bt 
separated from thee. 

My divine Redeemer, never will I leave Thee again. Even 
should all others leave Thee I will remain faithful to Thee, 
should it even cost me my life. I solemnly protest that 
were there neither paradise nor hell, I would never cease 
loving Thee, since, my Love, Thou art always worthy of 
infinite love. 

If I could begin my life anew, I would employ it wholly 
in loving Thee ; but I can not recall the years I have lost. 
I give Thee thanks for having borne with me until now, 
and not having cast me away from Thee for ever. 

Since Thou hast spared me it is but just that I should 
consecrate the rest of my life to Thee. May all my thoughts 
desires, and affections be pleasing to Thee. 

My beloved Jesus! I renew my vows; I accept with re 
newed fervor all the obligations and all the sacrifices of my 
state of life, for love of Thee. I will be more devoted than 
ever ttt my Holy Rule, for it is the expression of Thy will. 
And at my last hour, when Thy holy image shall be pressed 
to my dying lips, when all the world shall not be able to 
help me/ then do Thou not abandon me; for Thou art my 
Redeemer. Receive me into Thy Sacred Heart, and may 
my last sigh be a sigh of love, so that I may love Thee and 
bless Thee eternally. 

ACT OF ATONEMENT.

O Heart of Jesus, zealous lover of souls! 

V. The more pride and sensuality tend to destroy abne 
gation and love of duty, 

R, The more generous we will be in overcoming ourselves, 
O Heart of Jesus! 

Jesus, make us such true apostles of Thy Heart, that 
reparation to Thee may be our best reward. Amen. 

Good Jesus, Who alone orderest all things well, 

1 cast myself upon Thine infinite, undeserved love: 

I trust Thee with my all ... myself, and all whom I love, 
and all that I desire, 

My present and my future, my hopes, and my fears, 
My time and my eternity, my joys and my sorrows, 
Deal with me as Thou wiliest and knowest best, 
Only bind me safe to Thine everlasting love ! 

Prayer. 

ADORE thee, O Sacred Heart of Jesus, the joy, the 
satisfaction, and the supreme ruler of all hearts. With 
the same loving kindness that led thee to take the hand of 
St. Thomas, and carry it thyself into thy side, make my 
heart soek no joy but in thee, O Sacred Heart. May my 
heart be ever subject to thy gentle sway, for out of thee it 
will find but labor and tribulation, and all the evils of an 
unhappy bondage. Amen.

Prayer. 



Jesus, Who hast said: "Ask, and you shall 
receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall 
be opened unto you," behold me prostrate at Thy feet, ani 
mated with a lively faith and confidence in these promises, 
dictated by Thy Sacred Heart and pronounced by Thy 
adorable lips. I come to ask [here mention the request]. To 
whom can I address myself if not to Thee, Whose Heart is 
an inexhaustible source of all graces and merits? Where 
should I seek for graces if not in the treasure which contains 
all the riches of Thy clemency and bounty? Where must I 
knock if it be not at the door through which God communi 
cates Himself to us and through which we go to God? To 
thee, then, O Heart of Jesus, I have recourse; in thee I 
find consolation when afflicted, protection when persecuted, 
strength when overwhelmed with trials, and light in doubt 
and darkness. 

Thou canst bestow on me the grace which I implore. 
Thou hast only to will it and my prayer is granted. I 
acknowledge that I am most unworthy of Thy favors, 
O Jesus! But Thou art the God of mercy, and Thou 
wilt not refuse a contrite heart. Cast upon me a loo) 
of mercy, I conjure Thee, and Thy compassionate Hea; t 
will find in my miseries and weakness a pressing rnoti e 
for granting my petition. O Sacred Heart, whatever may 
be thy decision with regard to my request, I will never cease 
to adore, love, praise, and serve thee. Deign, my Jesus, 
to accept this, my act of perfect submission to the decrees 
of Thy Adorable Heart, which I sincerely desire may be 
fulfilled in and by me and all Thy creatures for ever and ever. 
Amen. *

THE HEART OF JESUS THE SOURCE OF ALL HAPPINESS. 

HERE is one thing for which every heart craves, after 
its own manner. We all long for happiness that 
is the one great desire that lives in every soul. Hast Thou 
not, sweet Jesus, given us that longing? And when Thou 
hast given so much, surely Thou wilt not refuse the accom 
plishment of this desire also. Tell us, dear Lord, what souls 
are happy, and we will learn from their example. Let us 
look at the faces of those who serve Thee, and we will see 
them growing brighter and brighter as they draw near Thee, 
and they will tell us: When we love Thee sincerely, then 
we shall be happy; when we make Thy will the renter around 
which we move, then we shall be happy; when Thy sweet 
Heart, hidden under the sacramental species, is more beau 
tiful in our sight than all else, when we shape and mould 
our lives according to the example of that Sacred Heart, 
then peace and joy and happiness will be ours. Teach us, 
sweet Heart of Jesus, from thy tabernacle, to serve thee as 
thou deservest, to love thee above all things, to work or 
thee bravely and generously, solely because of thy love 
and not for thy gifts. Oh, what happiness may I not promi: -e 
myself if I but cling to Thy most generous Heart, and use 
my best endeavors to faithfully serve and love Thee. In 
flame my heart with the love of Thee. With St. Ignatius I 
pray: Lord Jesus, give me but Thy love and Thy grace; 
more than this I do not ask." My Jesus, I love Thee with 
my whole heart and above all things Let me live but for 
Thee; let me die in Thy grace.

O SACRED Heart of Jesus, do thou teach me an entire 
forgetfulness of myself, since there is no other way 
of entering into thee. Grant that I may do nothing that 
is not worthy of thee. Teach me what I ought to do to 
attain to thy pure love, with the desire of which thou hast 
inspired me. I feel in myself a great wish to please thee, 
and a great inability to do so without special light and assist 
ance, which I can look for only from th e. Do Thou accom 
plish in me, O Lord, Thy will. I oppose it, I know well; 
but I would fain not do so. It is for thee, O Divine Heart, 
to do all; thine alone shall be the glory of my sanctifica-

It will be greatly to thy glory; and it is for this alone I desire 
to be perfect. Amen.

OMOST adorable and sacred Heart of Jesus! I consecrate 
to thee my soul with all its faculties, my heart with all

of my life. O most merciful Heart of Jesus! grant that I may 
never be sullied by the stain of mortal sin, andthatlmay avoid, to 
the best of my power, wilful venial sin. O most loving Heart of 
Jesus ! preserve me in Thy divine fear and love all the days of my 
life, protect me at the hour of my death, and grant me the grace 
to see God "face to face" in the joys of paradise. Amen. 

Adorable Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us! 

Immaculate heart of Mary, pray for us! 

ACT OF CONSECRATION AND LOVE COMPOSED BY BLESSED 
MARGARET MARY ALACOQUE. 

I, N. N., give and consecrate to the Sacred Heart of 
Our Lord Jesus Christ my person and my life, my 
actions, penances, and sufferings, not wishing to make use 
of any part of my being for the future except in honoring, 
loving, and glorifying that sacred Heart. 

It is my irrevocable will to be entirely His, and to do 
everything for His love, renouncing with my whole heart 
whatever might displease Him. 

I take Thee then, O most sacred Heart, as the sole 
object of my love, as the protector of my life, as the pledge 
of my salvation, as the remedy of my frailty and incon 
stancy, as the repairer of all the defects of my life, and 
as my secure refuge in the hour of death. 

Be then, O Heart of goodness, my justification before 
God the Father, and remove far from me the thunderbolts 
of His just wrath. O Heart of love, I place my whole 
confidence in Thee. While I fear all things from my 
malice and frailty, I hope all things from Thy goodness. 

Consume, then, in me whatever can displease or be 
opposed to Thee, and may Thy pure love be so deeply 
impressed upon my heart that it may be impossible that 
I should ever be separated from Thee, or forget Thee. 

I implore Thee, by all Thy goodness, that my name may 
be written in Thee, for in Thee I wish to place all my hap 
piness and all my glory, living and dying in very bondage 
to Thee. Amen. BLESSED MARGARET MARY ALACOQUE.

674 Thursday : The Blessed Sacrament 

A NOVENA FOR A SPECIAL INTENTION 

V 7"T &amp;gt; DORABLE Heart of Jesus! Furnace of love! Ocean 
j^jL, of boundless mercy! Consolation of the afflicted! 
Refuge of sinners, and hope of the whole world! I kneel 
before thee in humble and fervent adoration, while I unite 
my supplications to the perpetual homage thou thyself 
renderest to the Divinity on our altars. Most amiable 
Heart! having loved us with an eternal love, supply thy 
self for my insensibility, and receive my desire at least 
of loving thee with all the ardor and sincerity thou so 
justly meritest. But remember, O Adorable Heart! that 
thou hast disclosed thyself to us not only as an object 
of our adoration ; thou desirest much more to engage our 
love, and to become the ground and motive of our tender 
confidence. For this end thou wert pierced through with a 
lance on the cross ; and for this same purpose thou remainest 
a daily victim of thine own love on our altars. O infinitely 
compassionate Heart of Jesus! which was overwhelmed 
with sorrow in the Garden of Olives, at the view of our 
spiritual and corporal miseries, I come to thee now with all 
the confidence thou desirest I should repose in the extent of 
thy power and the riches of thy mercy. O my God ! convinced 
that those things which are impossible to human means are 
infinitely easy to thee, and relying with a humble, steadfast 
faith on the sacred words of truth itself, that whatever we 
ask the Father in the name of Jesus should be granted, I 
now most humbly implore in that adorable name, in virtue 
of that promise, and through the abundant mercies of the 
Sacred Heart of Jesus, the particular favor I petition for i \ 
this novena. [Specify it.] 

O blessed Margaret Mary! St. Gertrude! and all ye glori 
ous servants of Christ, who while on earth were particularly 
devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, join your prayen 
with mine and obtain from the divine Object of all your 
devotion the concession of the favor which I now request. 
Beg likewise of this adorable Heart, which has dominion 
over all hearts, and could in a moment change the most 
obdurate, to have compassion on those who are in the dread 
ful state of mortal sin, and to open to us all the treasures of 
its mercy at the hour of our death. Amen. 

NOVENA TO BLESSED MARGARET MARY. 

O BLESSED Margaret Mary, whose wonderful intimacy 
with Our Lord inspires all thy clients with confidence, 
exert, we beseech thee, thy influence with His Divine Heart, 



and the Sacred Heart. 675 

excite its compassion for us in our present necessity, and 
obtain what we sc earnestly ask in this novena. How many 
graces, how many conversions thy prayers and penances, 
when thou didst dwell on earth, drew from that Ocean of 
love and mercy! Be not less zealous now, but let us soon feel 
the effects of thy powerful intercession with the Sacred Heart 
of Jesus. Amen. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Father. 

Consecration of IReligtous Communities an&amp; families. 

*TTTDORABLE Heart of Jesus, mindful of these words 
vJ&amp;lt;-*^ of ineffable love: "Come to Me, all you that 
labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you," in 
the trials and sorrows of our times, we, though most 
unworthy, yet with contrite and humble hearts, approach 
thee with confidence as our divine Friend, to conse 
crate to thee most solemnly and for ever, our house, our 
selves, and all our possessions. We kneel before thee 
in profound adoration, in fervent thanksgiving for the 
numberless graces and blessings that have flowed down 
upon our Community (or family) from the tabernacle; 
in reparation also for our own irreverences and the 
offences of others against thee in the Sacrament of thy 
love, and finally in earnest supplication that our prayers, 
works, and sufferings, which we now consecrate to thee, 
may please thee, and give glory to thy eternal Father. 
We devote and consecrate our lives to thee, O Sacred 
Heart of Jesus, resolving firmly to love thee more fer 
vently and constantly, to imitate thy virtues, to do 
what we can to propagate devotion to thee, and to 
labor and suffer in union with thee, for the heavenly 
Father s glory, our own sanctification, and the salvation 
of souls. 

May thy blessing descend upon this house and upon 
those who dwell therein, that all may become more 
pleasing to thee by meekness, humility, charity, con 
formity to the will of God, self-denial, patience with

one another, and in particular by devotedness to their 
respective duties. 

May all cultivate a life that is hidden in God an 
-interior life, without selfishness or egotism, and with a 
sole view to advancing in the science of the saints, and 
to promoting the glory of God. Deign to look down upon 
us graciously, and to seal our good resolutions with thy 
grace, so that they may ever remain firm and unchange 
able. 

Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us; immaculate heart of 
Mary, pray for us; dear St. Joseph, protect us; guardian 
angel, defend us; all ye saints, intercede for us." Amen.

Devotion to tbe Sacreo Ibcart. 

fT\OTHER Julie Hilliart, foundress of the Sisters of Notre 
?**** Dame, who died at Namur in 1866, had always a 
great devotion to the Sacred Heart and boundless confidence 
iu it. It was to this Divine Heart that she owed the cure 
of a most painful malady that had afflicted her for more 
than thirty years. Father Enfantin, a man of great faith, 
begged her, one day, to join him in making a novena to the 
Sacred Heart. On Friday, June 8, 1804, the very day of 
the Feast of the Sacred Heart and the fifth day of the novena 
the Father went to see Mother Julie. The first tiling he said 
to her was: "Mother, if you have faith, take just one step 
in honor of the Heart of Jesus." Julie rose and advanced a 
step, the first she had taken for twenty-two years. "Now 
advance another," said the Father; she obeyed. " One more," 
and again she ol&amp;gt;eyed. "That v.ill do," said the missionary; 
" now, sit do\vn." She sat down saying that she was cured, as 
indeed she was. Her heart was inseparably united, as it 
were, to the Heart of Jesus, the one object of her thoughts 
and affections. One day she wrote to her companions: 
" How sweet it is to dwell in the Heart of Jesus! Let us never 
leave it, dear daughters; let us all live there in love, let us all 
die there of love." As soon as she had gathered round her 
some few helpers in her work, her first thought was to con 
secrate herself, together with them, to the Sacred Heart of 
Jesus and the immaculate heart of Mary. Here is a part of 
the formula which the venerable foundress herself wrote for 
this first consecration; 



and the Sacred Heart. 677 

"Jesus, my King and my God, I consecrate myself to Thy 
Sacred Heart for time and for eternity. To this Divine Heart 
1 consecrate all that I am, all that I have, all that I hope for: 
my liberty, my soul, and all its powers, my memory, my 
understanding, my will, my imagination, my body with all 
its senses, all my thoughts, my desires, my words, my actions, 
my affections, my designs, all my spiritual and corporal 
sufferings, all my present merits and those of the future, 
every moment of my life, and especially my last sigh. I also 
bind myself, my Jesus, to foster and to propagate the devo

^^HERE are various forms of the "Beads of the Sacred 
\~) Heart," composed of different sets of indulgenced 
prayers. There is no need, however, for special beads. By 
repeating certain indulgenced ejaculations, according to 
one s choice, with the ordinary string of beads, a perfect 
treasury of indulgences is obtained. As a private form of 
devotion, it can be adapted to one s inclination. 

Some printed forms of the Sacred Heart Beads are mis- 
jfeading, because they do not discriminate carefully enough 
between ejaculations that have an indulgence attached 
for each recitation, and such as have an indulgence that 
:an be gained but once a day. 

ON THE CROSS. 

SOUL of Christ, sanctify me! Body of Christ, save me! 
Blood of Christ, inebriate me! Water from the side 
of Christ, wash me! Passion of Christ, strengthen me! O 
good Jesus, hear me; within Thy wounds, hide me; permit 
me not to be separated from Thee; from the malignant enemy, 
defend me; in the hour of death call me and bid me come 
to Thee, that with Thy saints, I may praise Thee, for ever 
and ever. Amen.

thou hast reserved for those who love thee. Amen.

A SHORT ACT OF CONSECRATION. 
(Recommended to Promoters.) 

JESUS, Saviour of mankind, Thou hast mercifully

the Blessed Sacrament in union with Thy mediation in 
heaven for us, poor sinners, I consecrate myself entirely 
to Thee, for the glory of God and the salvation of souls. I 
promise to aid in spreading the worship and in promoting

my Advocate, and my Mother, and I am resolved to imitate 
her virtues, in particular her love for sinners, and to foster 
and promote devotion to her Immaculate Conception. I 
beseech Thee humbly to accept this promise. Thou hast 
inspired me to make it ; grant me the grace to fulfil it. Amen. 

Sweet Heart of Jesus, be my love! 

Sweet heart of Mary, be my salvation!

Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 683 



H&amp;gt;ev&amp;gt;otions in Ibonor of tbe {passion of 
ur Xoro.* 

ftbougbts from tbe Saints. 

ST. Bonaventure says: "He who desires to go on ad 
vancing from virtue to virtue, from grace to grace, 
should constantly meditate on the Passion of Jesus Christ. 
There is no exercise more profitable for the entire sanctifi- 
cation of the soul than frequent meditation on the sufferings 
of Our Lord." 

He who frequently reflects on the Passion, can not live 
without loving Jesus Christ. As St. Paul says: "The charity 
of Christ presseth us" (2 Cor. v. 14). 

Such a one will feel himself so constrained by the Saviour s 
ineffable love for him, that he will not possibly be able to 
refrain from loving a God so full of love, Who has suffered 
so much to win our love. Hence, the Apostle of the Gentiles 
said that he desired to know nothing but Jesus, and Jesus 
crucified. "I judged not myself to know anything among 
you but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified" (i Cor. ii. 2). All 
the saints have learned the art of loving God from the study 
of the crucifix. St. Francis of Assisi found no subject on 
which he exhorted his brethren with greater eagerness than 
the constant remembrance of the Passion of Jesus. 

"As for myself," writes St. Alphonsus, "I can never be 
satiated with meditating on the Passion of our divine Re 
deemer. In this subject I find everything. To meditate 
well on it teaches the perfect observance of the vows and 
rules, the love of contempt and of the trials that are insep 
arable from the religious life. He will never effect much 
who does not carry Jesus Christ crucified in his heart. He 
who keeps his Redeemer in view, cannot but love Him truly." 
Jesus Christ crucified should be our love, our life, our treasure, 
our all. With St. Paul, we ought to be able to say: "With 
Christ I am nailed to the cross; and I live, now not I, but 
Christ liveth in me. ... I live in the faith of the Son of 
God, Who loved me and delivered Himself for me" (Gal. ii. 19, 
20). 



* The devotions in honor of the Sacred Heart are usually 
given to Friday. All the suitable Sacred Heart prayers will be 
found in conjunction with the devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, 
beginning page 60 1. See foot-note on page 547.

Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 687 
Cbe Wa Cruets or Mag of tbe Cro06. 

To gain the many plenary and partial indulgences annexed 
to the "Way of the Cross," only two conditions are necessary. 

1. To follow the Stations (where they are canonically erected), 
moving from one to another without any notable interruption. 

2. To meditate on the Passion. 

A PREPARATION FOR THE WAY OF THE CROSS. 

*-|^vO we all remember how holy and how easy a manner 
JLJ of honoring our dear Saviour s Passion it is to follow 
the " Way of the Cross " ? How pleasing this is to Our Lord 
we may judge from His own words to St. Gertrude: 
they who handle flour can not but be whitened by it, so no 
one, however imperfect his devotion may be, can occupy 
his mind with the Passion, without receiving some benefit. 
However grievous the load of a man s sins, he may take 
comfort in the hope of pardon, if he offer to God the Father 
My Passion and death." The Church bestows on those who 
perform this devotion all the indulgences formerly granted 
to those who devoutly visited the Holy Land, and venerated 
the very spots on which Our Saviour suffered. 

It is very easy to make the Stations. Only one condition 
is required: to think about Our Lord s sufferings as we visit 
each of the fourteen Stations in turn. We are not obliged 
to remain long at each one. No prayers are enjoined ; we 
have only to think of Our Lord s sufferings; and when the 
pictures are before our eyes, this is not difficult. 

And yet, how greatly neglected is this easiest and most 
profitable devotion, because men think it too hard for 
them! Like the beads, it is a devotion particularly suited 
to those who can not read. 

The Stations begin when Our Lord is condemned to death. 
If we have in our minds what He had gone through before 
that moment, we shall make them more devoutly. Our 
Lord had washed His disciples feet; He had pra&amp;gt;ed, and 
spoken words of love to them; He had given them His 
blessed body and blood. In the Garden of Gethsemane, 
the three disciples had fallen asleep. He was offered because 
He willed it." Yet His soul shrank in fear and horror from 
the coming torments, all of which He clearly saw, from 
which there was no escape, and in which no one would stand 
by Him. An agony of shame and sorrow for all the sins He 
had taken upon Him then overwhelmed Him. O blessed 
contrition of the Son of God, which gives such value to our 



688 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

poor acts of sorrow! This agony was followed by another, 
that of weariness and desolation at the ingratitude of so 
many who would reject and despise all He was about to 
suffer for their love. "My soul is sorrowful unto death." 
At length an angel is sent to Him O divine humility of the 
Son of God, to accept comfort from His own creature! Next 
comes the betrayal the kiss of Judas Jesus is seized and 
bound, His right hand passes through the half-secured coil 
of rope and is stretched out, as of old, to heal the ear of His 
enemy then it returns to its fetters; He is now dragged 
before the judges and is disowned by His disciple Peter. . 
The terrible scourging follows, and after it the crowning 
with thorns. What must be the extent of the evil of sin, 
which demands so great a satisfaction! 

Such was Our Lord s preparation for making the "Way 
of the Cross." 

FIRST STATION. 

Jesus Christ Condemned to Death. 
"God did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for 

us all." 

V. We adore Thee, O Christ, and we bless Thee. 
R. Because by Thy holy cross Thou hast redeemed the world. 
(This versicle and response are repeated before each station.) 

/f\ I HILE Pilate condemns Him to death, Jesus in His 
VXA. Heart renews His unshaken resolution to suffer 
His Passion and to undergo this cruel death for us. For 
the love of me He overcomes all the repugnance of nature. 
Is my determination to die to myself, to carry out my good 
resolutions as strong? He endures so much, and asks so 
little. If I refuse that little can I be said to love Him? 
Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be to the Fattier. 

V. Have mercy upon us, O Lord. 
R. Have rnercy upon us. 
V. May the souls of the faithful, etc. 
R. Amen. 

St&amp;gt;ibat Mater.

Jesus Receives the Cross. 
"The Lord hath laid upon Him the iniquity of us all; for the 

sins of His people He hath struck Him." 

J7ESUS embraces His cross, takes it on His shoulders,

When St. Andrew cried out: "O good cross!" he had but a

spark of Our Lord s love of the cross How do I carry my 
daily cross? the cross of my state, of my daily duties, of ill 
ness, of interior and exterior sufferings? 

May the example of our divine Master make us renew 
our resignation and our love of the cross; our perseverance 
in carrying it courageously. 

Our Father, etc., as above

Truly He took upon Himself our pains, and He bore our sorrows." 
T7ESUS falls under the weight of the cross. His suffer- 
c) ings are intense, inconceivable. He is grieved at 
His fall because it delays His sacrifice. "With desire I have 
desired" to accomplish My Passion. But He is not irritated 
either with Himself or His executioners; calmly and with 
resignation He continues His way. Do I rise promptly after 
each fall, making my act of contrition, which at once casts 
out the poison of sin; and calmly resume my way, renewing 
my sorrow at the next Examen and at Confession? 
Oiir Father, etc., as above. 

FOURTH STATION. 

Jesus is Met by His Blessed Mother. 

" O all ye that pass by, attend and see if there be sorrow like untc 

my sorrow." 

/ TTT HY did Jesus permit this painful meeting? He wished 
vJtA to make Mary a partaker of His Passion. She was 
to become my Mother by sharing His sufferings. Oh, how 
much my Mother Mary loves me! For my sake she gives up 
her adorable, her best-beloved Son to torments and death. 
What is my love, my devotion toward her? Do I frequently 
invoke this loving Mother? Am I faithful in honoring her 
by the Rosary and other practices? 

Our Father, etc. as above. 

FIFTH STATION. 

The Cross is Laid upon Simon of Cyrene. 
"It behooveth us to glory in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ." 

OUR Lord can no longer carry His cross alone; yet no 
one offers to help Him. Simon of Cyrene is forced 
to do so and soon his heart is changed ; he learns to love the 
cross. Jesus wishes to help rne to carry my cross, but He 



690 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

desires to be urged to do so. I must pray, and keep near 
Him, by my fervor in my spiritual Exercises, Mass, holy 
communion, by ejaculatory prayers and remembrance of 
the presence of God 

Our Father, etc., as above. 

SIXTH STATION. 

The Face of Jesus is Wiped by Veronica. 
"Turn not Thy face from me, O Lord, and withdraw not in 

anger from Thy servant." 

E pious Veronica braves danger and insults in order 
to solace the sufferings of Jesus. He, in return, im 
prints His sacred features on her veil with sweat and blood. 
My divine Saviour wishes me to reproduce His features in 
my soul ; but that it may be so there must be sweat : labors, 
efforts, and struggle; blood: mortification, pain, suffering. 
Without this my desire of holiness is vain. 
Our Father, etc., as above. 

SEVENTH STATION. 

Jesus falls a Second Time. 
"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and outcast of 

the people." 

falls a second time, yet in spite of the cnielty 
of His executioners, notwithstanding His extreme 
weakness, and His terror at the approach of death, His courage 
does not fail ; He rises generously to continue His painful road 
with even greater courage. My Saviour, grant that I may 
profit by this example. A first fall astonishes me; by 
a second and a third I am quite overcome. I scarcely rise, 
and then how feebly! The enemy whispers to me: "If you 
rise let it be languidly." But by His example Jesus says: 
"Rise energetically." This one point well observed would 
assure my progress in holiness. 

Our Father, etc., as above. 

EIGHTH STATION. 

The Women of Jerusalem Mourn for Our Lord. 
"The crown has fallen from our head; woe unto us, for we have 

sinned." 

is followed by a crowd of compassionate women 
weeping and lamenting. Touched by their com 
passion He forgets His own sorrows and says to them: 



JJevoiions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 691 

" Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but for yourselves 
and for your children." The sentiment of compassion is 
good, but the compassion that leads to action is better. 
I must weep over my faults, and, better still, fight against 
the principal source of them: my predominant passion. 
"Behold," says Jesus, "how I trample under foot pride, 
sensuality and the passions of the human heart by My 
excesses of humiliation and suffering and will you not weep 
over yourseli?" Not to deserve these reproaches of my 
Saviour I will assiduously practice the Particular Examen. 
Our Father, etc., as abore. 

NINTH STATION. 

Jesus falls the Third Time Under the Cross. 

"My people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I grieved 
thee? Answer thou Me." 

77ESUS again gives me a lesson how I ought to persevere 
J in rising after my falls. Rising anew after each full, 
and notwithstanding His weakness, He reaches the summit 
of Calvary. What is it that can help me after my guilty 
and repeated falls? A holy obstinacy in always rising again, 
in never giving up my resolutions; this is true perseverance 
an&amp;lt;? assured sanctity. Am I thus resolved never to abandon 
the struggle ? 

Our Father, etc., as above 

TENTH STATION 
Jesus is Stripped of Pits Garments. 

"The Lord hath laid upon Him the iniquity of us all, and by His 
stripes we are healed." 

IN this mystery Jesus expiates especially the sensual 
pleasures and guilty voluptuousness of mankind. Am 
I. fully determined never to give Him anything to expiate 
or to suffer upon this account? "Blessed are the clean of 
heart " Seeing all that my Saviour endures, I will be care 
ful never to run any risk of sinning, to avoid all occasions 
of danger and not seek to know, to see, read or think of any 
thing that would sully my soul. On the contrary I will 
patiently suffer pain, and be faithful to the practice of cor 
poral mortification. 

Our Father, etc., as above.

ELEVENTH STATION. 

Jesus is Nailed to tlie Cross. 

" What are these wounds that I see in the midst of Thy hands ? 

They are the wounds that I have received in the house of 

those who loved Me! " 

r/ESUS gives Himself up to His executioners who pierc^ 
J His sacred hands and feet with cruel riails. "They 
have pierced My hands and feet; they have numbered all 
My bones." "He was crucified even for us" becoming 
obedient unto death, even unto the death of the cross. 
What a sublime lesson of obedience! After the example of 
my divine Saviour, am I thus ready to suffer any pain rather 
than not obey my Superiors? My Lord does this but do 
I not sometimes refuse to obey for fear of a little pain or a 
trifling inconvenience? Ought I not to be more generous 
and say: "Stainless will I live, or rather die"? 
Our Father, etc., as above 

TWELFTH STATION. 

Jesus Dies Upon the Cross. 

"Christ was made obedient for us unto death, even unto the 
death of the cross." 

*S Jesus hangs upon the cross He utters the cry of anguish : 
"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me!" 
"All," then "is consummated" Hanging there, one living 
mass of pain, suffering the keenest excess of agony in every 
power of His holy soul, in every limb and sense of His sacred 
body, He has redeemed me like a God. "Because with 
the Lord there is mercy, and with Him plentiful Redemption." 
Who can doubt of pardon, having such a victim to offer to 
the Eternal Father, and not exclaim when tempted to des 
pondency: "Father, into Thy hands I commend, my spirit" ? 
Thus Jesus accomplishes His work of devotedness and sac 
rifice. " Behold this Heart," He says, " which has so loved 
men!" Can I now spare myself? Ought I not to devote 
myself entirely to His interests, to my work, especially that 
which is hard and difficult, and even say with His saints: 
"Still more suffering, O Lord, still more!" 
Our Father, etc., as above. 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 693 

THIRTEENTH STATION. 
Jesus is Laid in the arms of His Blessed Matter. 

"Holy Mother, pierce me through; in my heart each wound 
renew of my Saviour crucified." 

V3TT*HAT anguish must have been that of Mary when the 
VxA* lifeless body of her divine Son was placed in her 
arms! 

Each wound of His was a sword which pierced her immacu 
late heart. And yet Mary is the Queen of heaven and earth, 
and beloved by God more than all other creatures together. 
Suffering is, then, the sign of His love, and I must not refuse 
to be treated like my Mother. I must abandon myself 
with confidence to all the designs of God s sweet providence 
and not change into poison, by my impatience, the gifts 
God sends me to make me like His Son. 

Our Father, etc., as above. 

FOURTEENTH STATION, 

Jesus is Laid in the Scpulcher. 
"Thou wilt not give Thy holy One to see corruption." 

IN the holy sepulcher there is no natural life, but only 
the divine. The sacred wounds are there, the mangled 
body, but what peace there is on those features, what serenity 
on that brow! So will it be with me when nature is dead in 
me, and when my passions are quelled. To attain to this 
supernatural life I will practice exterior recollection by 
silence and modesty of demeanor, and interior recollection 
by seeking the things that are above. 

Our Father, etc., as above. 

Let us pray. 

"I OOK down, O Lord, we beseech Thee, on this Thy 
^Ii family, for which Our Lord Jesus Christ did not hesi 
tate to be delivered into the hands of wicked men, and to 
suffer the torment of the cross. Who livest and reignest 
world without end. Amen. 

Five Our Fathers, Hail Marys and Glory for the intention of

HOW PLEASING IT IS TO OUR LORD TO PRAY WITH HANDS OUT 
STRETCHED IN THE FORM OF A CROSS. 

BT. Gertrude said to Our Lord : Teach me, O Thou best 
Teacher, one way at least in which we may most 
specially commemorate Thy holy Passion. Our Lord answered 
her thus: "When you pray, spread forth your hands so as to 
represent to God the Father the memory of My Passion, in 
union with that love with which I stretched out My hands 
on the cross; and if you do this habitually, without fear of 
ridicule or reproach, you will pay Me an honor as great as 
is shown to a king when he is solemnly enthroned." 

ST. GERTRUDE S OFFERING TO GOD OF THE LIFE AND SUFFER 
INGS OF OUR LORD. 

HATHER Dignam, S.J., on the occasion of a retreat, 
once said to the Sisters : The Passion is our treasure. 
You know well that little book of St. Gertrude s in which 
she makes that long and beautiful offering to God of the life 
and sufferings of Our Lord. There is a shorter form which 
you might use now and again, especially in Lent, till the 
spirit of it sinks deep into your souls and has become, as it 
was with St. Gertrude, an habitual thought, and until, like 
her, you are constantly offering it to God for yourself and 
others. If you gain but one grace even, a truer and more 
abiding sorrow for sin, your industry during Lent will not 
have been spent in vain." 

This prayer was revealed to St. Gertrude during a mar 
velous and unusual visitation of grace, and she was told 
at the same time that Our Lord would accept it with singu 
lar favor from all who repeated it It became so familiar 
to the saint that during her last illness she repeated it con 
tinually. 

OMOST loving Father, in atonement and satisfaction 
for all my sins, I offer Thee the whole Passion of 
Thy most beloved Son, from the plaintive wail He uttered 
when laid upon straw in the manger, through all the help 
lessness of His infancy, the privations of His boyhood, the 
adversities of His youth, the sufferings of His manhood, until 
that hour when He bowed His head upon the cross with a 
loud cry, and gave up the ghost. And, in atonement and 
satisfaction for all my negligences, I offer Thee, O most 
loving Father, all of the most holy life of Thy Son, perfect 



yoo Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

in its ever}- thought, and word, and action, from the hour 
when He came down from His lofty throne to the Virgin s 
womb, and thence came forth into our dreary wilderness, 
to the hour when He presented to Thy fatherly regard the 
glory of His conquering flesh. Amen. 

ACT OF RESIGNATION. 

rwas revealed to St. Gertrude that those who submit 
and conform themselves entirely to the divine will, 
desiring above all things that the adorable will of God may 
be most fully done in all that concerns them, whether in 
body or in soul, touch the Sacred Heart most sensibly. For 
such perfect resignation is an acknowledgment of God s 
sovereignty, ?.nd gives Him as much honor as is given to an 
earthly king when the crown of his realm is set on his head. 

OMOST holy Father, I, Thy poor and vile creature, en 
tirely renounce my own will, and offer and resign 
myself to Thy most holy will and pleasure; above all delights 
of this world, I wish and desire that Thy most adorable, 
most placid will may be perfectly done in me, by me, in all 
that concerns me, whether in body or in soul, in time and 
in eternity. And to this end I would readily submit all the 
members of my body to suffering of any kind and degree. 

O my God, wert Thou to give me fullest choice of asking 
all I wish, and didst Thou swear to me by Thyself that Thou 
wouldst grant my petition in all things, I would neither desire 
nor ask aught else than that Thy most adorable will may be 
perfectly done in me and in even creature of Thine, according 
to Thy supreme and faultless good pleasure. Wherefore, in 
union with that resignation with which Jesus committed 
Himself wholly to Thy will in the Garden of Olives, and in 
union with His affection and His intention, I say from His 
Heart and in His words: "Not my will, but Thine be done, 
O most holy Father, now and for evermore." Amen. 

INDULGENCED PRAYER IN HONOR OF THE PASSION OF OUR 
LORD. 

OMY Lord Jesus Christ! Who, to redeem the world, 
didst vouchsafe to be born amongst men, to be cir

gentle and innocent, to be bound with cords and dragged in 
scorn before the tribunals of Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, and

witnesses, to be torn by the scourge and overwhelmed with 
opprobrium ; to be spat upon, to be crowned with thorns, 
buffeted, struck with a reed bl ; ndfo 1 ded, stripped of Thy 
garments ; to be nailed to the cross and r aised on it between 
two thieves; to be given gall and vinegar to drink, and to 
be pierced with a ance; do Thou, O Lord, by these Thy 
most sacred pains, which I. all unworthy, call to mind, and 
by Thy holy cross and death, save me (and Thy servant X. 
in his agony *) from the pains of hell, and vouchsafe to bring 
me whither Thou didst bring the good thief who was crucified 
with Thee. Who, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, 
livest and reignest, God, for ever and ever. Amen.

/Bbontb of tbe precious 

E month of July is dedicated to the honor of the most 
precious blood, which was shed for the redemption 
of all mankind, and without which shedding, St. Paul tells 
us, there is no remission of sin. This great festival was 
established in a spirit of thanksgiving by His Holiness Pope 
Pius IX., while in exile at Gseta, at the request of the saintly 

feneral of the Congregation of the Most Precious Blood, 
lerlini. Earlier in the year, on the Friday after the fourth 
Sunday in Lent, this devotion has been commemorated 
by a special office. Catholic devotion consecrates the month 
of July to the precious blood, that blood which was the price 
of our redemption, and which still is offered for us in the 
mystic sacrifice of Calvary daily renewed on our altars in 
the Mass, and which becomes the nourishment of our souls 
and bodies when we partake worthily of the Sacrament of 
the altar. The contemplation of the sufferings of Our 
Saviour to which we are incited by devotion to the most 
precious blood, reminds us, His fo owers, that we are called 
upon to walk in the footprints of our suffering Saviour, if 
we desire to be crowned with Him. As St. Bernard puts 
it, the members of a thorn-crowned Head must not shrink 
from sharing in His pain. And so from the beginning of 
the establishment of Christ s Church the true children of 
a crucified Saviour have ever had to share in the bitterness of 
His anguish and oft times in the agony of His death. For 
three hundred years after Christ had ascended into heaven, 
countless martyrs shed their blood in attestation of their 
faith and love. Less fortunate than those glorious con 
fessors, cheerfully pouring out their life s blood for Christ, 
God pities our weakness and spares us sufferings under 
which we might have succumbed. But still for us, as for 
them, suffering, patiently borne, must be the golden key 
to open the gates of His kingdom. The saying is as true 
to-day as when Jesus first uttered it: "He who does not 
carry his cross after Me is not worthy of Me." There is 
no one that is released from treading in that path of tears 
that leads to Him. 

For what heart is without sorrow, we may ask? What 
life is not, at least, occasionally darkened by it? How 
many there are who seem to have it as their permanent 
portion! Some eyes scarcely ever cease from hidden weep 
ing, and some hearts are always pierced with the sword of 
hidden anguish! 

Bear your sorrows with patience, for the love of God, for

the sake of your soul, and in union with the sufferings of 
your Saviour, Jesus Christ. Sufferings are blessings in the 
light of faith. They bring us nearer to God. They make 
us resemble our divine Master. Do not fear! Sorrow will 
grow lighter with time or entirely pass away even as the 
agony, the scourge, the crown, and the cross gave place to 
the radiant glory of the Resurrection!*

Ceremonies of Ibolg Week 

PALM SUNDAY. 

Where there is only one priest, he says or sings the parts of the 
service which in High Mass are sung by the deacon and sub- 
deacon. 

E ceremony of Palm Sunday consists of three parts: 
First, the celebrant blesses and distributes palm- 
leaves (for which, on account of .the difficulty and expense 
of obtaining them in sufficient quantity, branches of box, 
willow, or yew are often substituted) to all present. Then 
comes the procession of palms; and thirdly, the holy Mass 
is offered, during which the "Passion" according to St. 
Matthew (being that evangelist s narrative of the sufferings 
and death of Our Saviour) is sung. 

Now, during this service the Church sets herself to picture 
to us two very opposite feelings: joy and gladness at her 
Master s triumphal entry into Jerusalem; bitter sorrow at 
His approaching death. On this day, the first day of the 
week of the Passover, the week in which Jesus died, He 
entered the holy city in triumph. We are told that His 
disciples were with Him; that the multitudes cut down 
branches of palm-trees, and cried aloud with one voice: 
"Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh 
in the name of the Lord!" At the same time the cloud of 
approaching tribulation was gathering dark and thick over 
the Church, for in five days her Master was to be crucified. 
To express to us, her children, these opposite emotions, she 
gives us, first, the blessing of palms, and, in the joyous pro 
cession, depicts the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem ; 
while, in the Mass that follows, the mournful chant of the 
Passion shadows forth the coming desolation. 

We shall now take each part separately, so that you may 
understand what the priest is doing while you follow him 
in your Holy- Week book. After the Asperges, which is the 
same as on other Sundays, except that the Gloria Patri is 
omitted, as is usual in Passiontide, the priest begins: 

/. Tlie Blessing of the Palms. 

IT is a rule in the Church s liturgy to bless and sanctify 
everything that is used in the service of God or given 
to the people. The palms are blessed with great solemnity, 
and, indeed, we might easily suppose that the Mass had

already begun, and was to be offered up in honor of Our 
Lord s entry into Jerusalem. After a Collect, the sub- 
deacon sings the Lesson, which relates how Moses and the 
children of Israel encamped in the wilderness under the 
seventy palm-trees at Elim; the deacon chants the Gospel, 
giving St. Matthew s account of this day; a Preface is sung, 
and even a Sanctus. After this preparation come the prayers 
of blessing, in which we are reminded of God s gracious 
mercies in the past; how the dove brought the olive-branch 
to Noe in the ark; and how God protected the Jews under 
the palm-trees of Elim. 

Then comes the distribution of the palms. Receive the 
palm kneeling; kiss it, as a mark of reverence to the blessing 
of the Church, and also kiss the priest s hand as an act of 
respect to the Church s ministers. During the procession, 
and while the Passion is sung, hold your palm in your hand. 

//. The Procession. 

*vS soon as the palms are distributed, the clergy and 
choir leave the sanctuary, following the cross-bearer 
and acolytes. The music is bright and joyous, in memory 
of the shouts of triumph which hailed Our King; while all 
carry palms to help us to realize the procession on this day 
in the holy city. The procession leaves the Church still 
singing, but on its return it finds the doors shut against it. 
Its progress is arrested, but its song of joy continues, until 
at length the subdeacon strikes the closed doors with the 
cross he is carrying. The doors are then thrown open, and 
all enter singing the praises of Our Saviour-God. By this 
symbolical act is signified that the gates of .heaven were 
shut against all men in punishment for the sin of our first 
parents, but that Jesus has opened these gates once more to 
us by His cross, which has triumphed over sin and death. 

III. The Mass. 

^~^HE third part of to-day s service is the offering of the 
\) holy sacrifice of the Mass. The parts sung by the 
choir are expressive of the deepest grief; and, indeed, the 
Church retains no trace of the short-lived joy and triumph 
of the procession of the palms. St. Matthew s narrative 
of the Passion, which is sung to-day before the Gospel, 
imparts to this Sunday that character of sacred gloom which 
is known to us all. For the last five or six hundred years 
the Church has adopted a special chant for this narrative 
of the holy Gospel. It is sung by three deacons (or priests 
vested as deacons) and the choir. One deacon takes the 
part of Chronicler, and sings all the narrative of the Evangelist 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 709 

Another deacon, called the Christus, sings in a low and plain 
tive voice the words spoken by our dear Lord Himself; the 
third takes at a high pitch the words of Pilate, Judas, and 
Caiphas, while the choir sings the words and exclamations 
of the crowd. When the Chronicler relates the death of 
Our Saviour, all kneel for a few moments in silent awe and 
contemplation of the sacrifice that is consummated. After 
this the Gospel is sung; but, to express our sorrow, lights 
are not carried; at the same time, to express the living 
hope of Our Master s triumph, we hold in our hands the 
palms of victory. 

After the Gospel, the Mass continues as usual to the end. 

TENEBR^E. 

Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of Holy Week. 
*ZJ S we enter the church we are struck by many signs 
,^X of mourning at this sacred time. The sanctuary looks 
deserted and unfurnished. The tabernacle stands open, 
for the Blessed Sacrament has been removed The veil of 
the tabernacle, flowers, and other ornaments are gone. 
Nothing remains on the altar except the veiled crucifix and 
the six candles. In the center of the sanctuary stands 
the book for the psalms and lessons. At the epistle side 
stands a large triangular candlestick, holding fifteen candles 
of common or unbleached wax. 

The Office at which we are now to assist is called Tenebrae 
(meaning darkness}, because it pictures to us, by the gradual 
darkening of the church, the more than iit-.tural darkness that 
overshadowed the world at the death of Jesus Christ. It is 
the preparation which the Church gives us that we may 
assist in proper dispositions at the sacred function which is 
to take place next morning. On Wednesday evening we 
sing the Tenebra of Thursday in preparation for the Mass 
and Office of Thursday. On Thursday evening we sing 
by anticipation the Office of Good Friday. On Friday eve- 
i ing we sing in preparation for the Office and Mass of Easter 
Eve. In early times these Offices were begun at midnight, 
but we are allowed to have them at an earlier hour in order 
to enable more of us to be present. 

The service consists of Matins and Lauds, and is a portion 
of the Divine Office which every priest of the Church is bound 
to say each day. We have remarked that no adornment 
and ornament, nothing but what is essential, is allowed to 
remain in the sanctuary during these days of mourning. 
Church carries this same spirit into her service of prayer, 
and leaves nothing in the Office save what is essential tc it 



710 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

the psalms and lessons. The versicles and hymns, the invi 
tations and responses which are used at other times, and 
form, so to speak, the drapery and adornment in which the 
psalms and lessons are clothed, are omitted on these days. 
The Matins consist of three parts, called Nocturns (night 
offices). Each nocturn is made up of three psalms and three 
lessons. The Lauds consist of five psalms, followed by 
the Canticle of Zachary (Bcnedictus), and the whole Office 
is closed with the 50th Psalm (Miserere) and a Collect. The 
Tenebrce service for Maundy Thursday in the psalms and 
lessons brings before us the Passion of Our Saviour, and in 
an especial way the treachery of Judas. In the third noc 
turn, however, the lessons appropriately relate St. Paul s 
account of the institution of the Holy Eucharist. 

The ceremonies of this service are rich in meaning. At 
the end of each psalm one of the candles in the triangular 
candlestick is extinguished, until, as the Office proceeds, 
one only is left alight. By this is shown forth how one by 
one the disciples forsook their Master and slunk away. The 
one candle that remains alight represents Jesus Christ for 
saken and left to "tread the wine-press alone." During 
the Canticle of Zachary (Bcnedictus) the six candles on the 
altar are put out, and the lights in the church are gradually 
lowered, to symbolize the noonday darkness that covered 
the earth at the death of its Creator. 

At the end of the Benedictus, the single candle that still 
burns is hidden behind the altar, while the Miserere is sung 
amid the gloom. A Collect is then said in a low voice 
by the senior priest present, and a confused noise is made, 
to express the convulsions of nature when the earth quaked, 
and the rocks were split, and the graves gave up their dead, 
The candle is then brought from behind the altar, still alight, 
to represent that, after His death and burial, our dear Lord 
came forth immortal from the tomb. The Office ended, all 
depart in silence. 

MAUNDY THURSDAY. 

r spite of the mourning of Holy Week, the Church can 
not allow this great day to pass without some signs of 
joy. It is the day of the Last Supper of our dear Lord 
the day on which He instituted the Most Holy Sacrament 
of the Eucharist; and in honor of that great Mystery the 
Church lays aside her mourning, at least during the celebra 
tion of holy Mass, and bids us deck the altar with our richest 
ornaments, and wear vestments of white, the color denoting 
joy and gladness. We would remind our readers that the 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 711 

Last Supper took place on the first day of the Azym.es, or 
the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, and it is for that reason 
that we always use unleavenc d bread for consecration in 
holy Mass. Again, to show forth the unity and greatness 
of this Supper, the Church allows en tnis day only one Mass 
to be offered in each church, at which the clergy and con 
gregation assist and receive holy communion, the priests 
wearing stoles, the token of their priesthood. This brings 
before us in a forcible way the scene in the upper chamber in 
Jerusalem, where Our Lord alone consecrated and then gave 
holy communion to those present. We shall divide our 
explanations of the service into three sections: 

I. The Mass. 

*MID the triumph of this great feast a web of sorrow is 
interwoven, to show that our joy is not lasting, for 
we have not forgotten the Passion of Jesus Christ. The 
celebrant intones the Gloria in excelsis, and the bells ring 
out joyously in answer to the organ s peals; but after that, 
both bells and organ are silent until Holy Saturday, to 
show the sorrow of the whole world at Our Saviour s death. 
The Collects recall to us Judas and the good thief; both 
are guilty, but one is pardoned. The kiss of peace is omitted, 
to show our horror of the treacherous kiss of Judas in the 
garden on this night. 

II. The Procession to the Altar of Repose. 

ON Good Friday, as we shall see, the Church suspends 
the offering of the holy sacrifice of the Mass, to 
commemorate in this solemn way the sacrifice that was 
offered on that day on Calvary. The priest consecrates 
two Hosts on Holy Thursday during the Mass. One of 
these he receives in holy communion; the other he rever 
ently places in a chalice, and reserves to be consumed on 
Good Friday. The Blessed Sacrament could not be reserved 
with fitting respect at the high altar, on account of the mourn 
ful ceremonies of this holy time ; and consequently a chapel 
or altar, apart from the high altar, is prepared and adorned 
with rich hangings, lights, and flowers; here our blessed 
Lord remains until Good Friday. When the Mass to-day 
is finished, the choir and clergy go in procession to this Chapel 
of Repose. After the cross-bearer and acolytes come the 
choir and clergy, singing the Pange Lingua, followed by 
the celebrant and sacred ministers under the canopy. The 
priest does not carry the monstrance, as in other processions, 
but the chalice, containing the Blessed Sacrament, covered 
with a veil. When he arrives at the Altar of Repose he 



yi2 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

places it in the tabernacle or urn, where it u ill remain until 
to-morrow s service. Until then Jesus will not be left alone 
by day and night loving souls will keep watch there in 
humble adoration, making amends for the scorn and insults 
which Jesus has suffered for our sins. More especially will 
they be present during the silent watches of the night; for 
this is the night when He suffered the agony in the garden 
and was betrayed by Judas, and delivered into the hands 
of His enemies. 

///. Stripping the Altars. 

f^HE procession then leaves the Altar of Repose, the 
\tf sacred ministers go to the sacristy, and the other 
clergy and choir go to the sanctuary to recite Vespers, which 
are said, not sung. At the end of Vespers the priests enter 
the sanctuary to strip the altar, as Jesus was stripped of 
His garments before the crucifixion. The ornaments and 
flowers that were there to denote our joyful commemoration 
of the institution of the Blessed Sacrament are taken away 
the very altar-cloths are stripped off, because the daily sac 
rifice is suspended, in coken of our grief: "They have parted 
My garments among them, and upon My vesture they have 
cast lots." The holy water is removed from the porch and 
none is put there until after the Mass on Holy Saturday 



GOOD FRIDAY. 



have come now to the day of the Church s widow- 
hood, and she would have it to be a day of desola 
tion, as her true children feel it to be. The sanctuary is 
altogether bare and unadorned. The altar was stripped 
of its ornaments yesterday morning, and nothing remains 
except the crucifix, now veiled in black, and the six candle 
sticks. The sanctuary carpet has been taken away, and 
even the candles are not lighted until the latter part of the 
function. To enable us to enter into the spirit of this ser 
vice, and to appreciate fully the meaning of its various, 
parts, we must bear in mind that to-day the priest does not 
offer sacrifice that he does not, so to say, stand in the place 
sf Jesus Christ and speak in His name and with His power; 
but rather as the spokesman and representative of the con 
gregation present: as a consequence of this, they follow 
and take part in the various acts of reparation he performs 
This is the key-note to the right understanding of the whole 
function. 

The service of to-day consists of a series of distinct actions. 
We shall divide our explanation into four parts: i. History, 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 713 

containing the Prophecies and the Passion according to St. 
John. 2. Supplication, containing public prayer for all 
sorts and conditions of men. 3. Reparation, containing the 
unveiling and adoration of the cross. 4. The Mass of the 
Presandified. 

I. The Passion. 

E choir and sacred ministers approach the sanctuary 
in silence. Neither incense nor lights are carried be 
fore them, and the vestments are black, "as when one mourn - 
eth." On the altar there is neither Missal nor altar-cloth. 
When the sacred ministers reach the sanctuary, instead of 
beginning by public prayer, they prostrate themselves on 
the ground in silence, while a cloth and the book are laid on 
the altar. They then rise, and at once proceed to read 
the Lessons and Collects, which bring before us the Paschal 
Lamb, the type of the Lamb of God, Who is to-day sacrificed 
for our sins. These Lessons prepare us for the "Passion," 
which gives us St. John s account of the terrible events of 
this great day. The Passion is sung, as on Palm Sunday, 
by three deacons (or priests), who each take a part, the 
choir sustaining, as before, the part of the multitude. 

II. The Prayers. 

*^^HE second part of the service consists of supplication 
\j and petition. The idea of the Church in this action 
is to make intercession with God on this day for all classes 
and conditions of men. While the Church bids us pray at 
all times for the conversion of sinners and evil-doers, on 
this day she makes public and official prayer for those who 
are enemies of the cross of Christ." For mercy knows 
no bounds; and our dying Saviour has given utterance to 
the words, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. 
The celebrant sings eight prayers, each of which is pref 
aced by a few words to show its object. Before each prayer 
the deacon bids us kneel for a moment, and the subdeacon 
bids us rise, to show by this bodily action our union in 
the petition made by the priest in our name. First comes 
the prayer for the spouse of Jesus Christ, the Church of God ; 
then the prayer for the Vicar of Jesus Christ, the Pope happily 
reigning ; then the prayer for bishops, priests, and other ser 
vants of the Church ; then the prayer for catechumens ; then the 
prayer for all in tribulation or danger; then the prayer for 
heretics and schismatics ; then the prayer for the Jews ; and, 
lastly, that our charity may embrace all human creatures 
for whom Jesus shed His blood, conies the prayer for pagans. 
Before the prayer for the Jews, the deacon refrains from 



714 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

bidding us to genuflect, because they turned this mark of 
adoration into an insult against Our Lord in His Passion. 

///. The Unveiling 0} the Cross. 

E third action in to-day s service is reparation. The 
Church will have us make what reparation we can to 
fesus Christ for the ignominy of His Passion by showing 
honor and veneration to the cross in memory of His cruci 
fixion to-day. Accordingly, the celebrant takes off his 
chasuble, the symbol of his priestly dignity, in order to be 
the first to humble himself on this day of mourning. He 
receives the veiled cross, and, standing at the side of the 
altar, he uncovers a small part, raising it slightly for people 
to see, and sings in a low voice: "Behold the wood of the 
cross, on which hung the salvation of the world;" and all 
kneel to pay their homage to the sign of our redemption. 
Mounting nearer the altar, he goes through the same cere 
mony a second time; and then, coming to the center of the 
altar, he removes the veil entirely, and lifting the cross aloft, 
sings in a high note the same words a third time, in memory 
of Our Saviour s words: "When I shall have been lifted up, 
I will draw all things to Myself." By this uncovering of 
the cross is represented the gradual preaching to the Jews 
and afterwards to the Gentiles the great mystery of the 
crucifixion, "to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the 
Gentiles foolishness." 

The celebrant then places the crucifix on the ground, and, 
in token of his humiliation and abasement, takes off his 
shoes, for the place whereon he stands is holy ground, and 
goes to kiss the feet of the figure that represents his dying 
Saviour. As he approaches, he kneels three times, and 
finally kisses devoutly the symbol of our redemption. All 
who are present follow his example, either at this crucifix 
or at one of the crosses in the side chapels (according to 
convenience), taking care to make three genuflections (not 
more) , and making the third close to the cross itself, so that 
as they kneel they can kiss the figure. During this touching 
ceremony, the choir sings in plaintive chants the Reproaches, 
which bring before us in a dramatic way the rebukes, loving 
and gentle, addressed by Our Saviour to the Jews. It will 
help us much to realize to-day s events if we read these 
Reproaches, which our dear Lord addresses now to us. 

IV. The Mass of the Presanctified. 

*j A r*E need not delay long over our explanation of the fourth 
VJcJL action in to-day s service the Mass of the Pre 
sanctified The candles on the altar are now lighted in 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 715 

reverence for the coming presence of Jesus Christ. The 
clergy go in procession to the Chapel of Repose, and bring 
back to the high altar the Blessed Sacrament, which has 
been reserved in a chalice since the Mass of yesterday. 
During the procession the choir sing the Vexilla Regis. On 
this day alone throughout the Christian year the Church 
suspends the offering of the holy sacrifice of the Mass, that 
our thoughts may be wholly taken up with the contemplation 
of the one sacrifice that was consummated to-day on Calvary. 
The Blessed Sacrament, which the celebrant receives to-day, 
was consecrated (or presanct-ified) yesterday. Consequently, 
since there is no actual sacrifice to-day, this part of the ser 
vice is called the Mass of the Presanctified. When the 
Blessed Sacrament is brought to the altar, the priest in 
censes it. He then turns to the people and bids them pray 
(orate, jraires), and himself prays aloud, singing the Pater 
Noster, he holds up for their adoration the sacred body 
of Our Lord, and then reverently receives it. To mark 
our raourning and confusion to-day, the priest does not 
remain at the altar to say any public prayers of thanksgiving 
or to give a blessing, as in other Masses; but straightway 
leaves the sanctuary. As soon as he departs, the Vespers 
are recited as yesterday, and the altars are stripped. The 
sanctuary is empty, its light is gone, no lamp burns in any 
part of the church, the pictures are veiled; the naked cross 
stands alone to proclaim the mourning of the spouse for 
the crucifixion of her Lord. "They shall mourn for Him, 
as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall grieve over 
Him as is the manner to grieve for the death of the first-born." 

HOLY SATURDAY. 

IT was the practice of the Church from the earliest ages 
that no Mass was said on Holy Saturday. For a 
thousand years after the foundation of the Church it was 
the custom to spend this day in prayer and fasting, in watch 
ing in spirit with the holy women at the sepulcher until the 
morning of the Resurrection. At midnight, on Friday, the 
Divine Office for Easter eve was sung; but the service and 
Mass that we have now on Holy Saturday really took place 
on Saturday night, and, extending till dawn on Sunday 
morning, was the immediate herald of the Resurrection. 
As the sun went down on Easter eve, the bishop and clergy 
and faithful used to repair to the church for this office, 
and its magnificent functions occupied the whole night, 
until sunrise on Easter Day. We should bear this in mind 
if we wish to enter into the spirit of this service, and if we

would understand the many allusions we find in it to the 
night. Another point to remember is, that the service of 
this night was specially ordained and fitted for the baptism 
of those converts, or catechumens, who had been previously 
found worthy of admission into the Christian Church. This 
will throw light upon the meaning of many of its cere 
monies and prayers. We shall divide the service into two 
sections: the Blessings and the Mass. 

I. Tlie Blessings. 

E Church, as we remarked on Palm Sunday, blesses 
and sanctifies everything she uses in her sacred func 
tions. Holy Saturday is in a special manner a day of bless 
ings, for it is in a sense the birthday of the Church. The 
service begins, not in the sanctuary, but at the very en 
trance to the Church, where new fire kindled from a flint is 
blessed. From this the light is taken for the candles and 
lamps throughout the church which were extinguished on 
Good Friday. This was of first importance in the early 
Church, that the faithful might have light for the long night 
ceremony. Five grains of incense are then blessed, and the 
deacon lights a triple candle (in honor of the Three Persons 
of the Adorable Trinity), and leads the way through the 
darkness to the sanctuary, thrice announcing as he goes 
Lumen Christi, the Light of Christ. When the procession 
reaches the sanctuary, the deacon chants his song of triumph 
(Exultef), and solemnly blesses the great Paschal candle. 
This candle is of unusual size, standing alone, of a pillar- 
like form; and in the ages when the service was held at 
night, shed a "dim religious light" over the sanctuary during 
the long vigil. When lighted, it is the representation both 
of the pillar of fire which went before the people of God in 
their wanderings through the desert, and of the new-born 
glory of Jesus risen from the grave. During this grand song 
of joy the deacon pauses three times ; once to fix in the candle 
the five grains of incense in the form of a cross, which, by 
their number, represent the five wounds, and, by their sub 
stance, the precious spices which the holy women brought to 
the sepulcher this night to embalm the body of their dead 
Lord ; a second time he pauses to light the newly blest 
candle; and a third time, while the lamps in the church 
are once more lighted. After this Erultet come the Twelve 
Prophecies, which were primarily intended for the instruc 
tion of the catechumens who w-ere to be baptized this night. 
Then comes the blessing of the baptismal font. In front 
of the procession is carried the Paschal candle, which leads 



Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 717 

these neophytes to the waters of salvation, even as the pillar 
of fire led the children of Israel to the saving waters of the 
Red Sea. When the celebrant reaches the baptistery, he 
sings the blessing of the font. He divides the water in the 
form of a cross, and scatters some toward the four quarters 
of the world; he breathes upon it, and invokes the grace 
and power of the Holy Ghost upon it. He dips the Paschal 
candle three times into the water. The people are then 
sprinkled with this Easter water, and after this the holy 
chrism and oil of catechumens is poured into the font to 
mingle with the baptismal water. This completes the 
solemn blessing of the font, and after this, formerly, .the 
catechumens were baptized and then confirmed. After the 
blessing of the font the procession returns to the sanctuary, 
and the litanies of the saints are sung, during which the 
celebrant and sacred ministers He prostrate before the 
altar. Toward the end of the litanies the priests rise and 
go to the sacristy to vest for Mass. 

II. The Mass. 

*S we have pointed out, the foregoing ceremonies for- 
merly took place during the night of Easter eve, and 
the Mass at which we are now going to assist is really the 
Mass that used to be offered at daybreak on Easter morn, 
after the long vigil. This will explain why it is of such a joy 
ous character. The vestments are white, the Gloria is sung, 
the bells ring out cheerfully, the organ is heard once more. 
Pictures and images are uncovered; flowers again adorn the 
altar, which is decked in white. The Collect of the Mass 
makes intercession for the newly baptized, "the new offspring 
of Thy family." After the Epistle, the celebrant intones 
solemnly three times the Alleluia, which is taken up by the 
choir; the Gospel relates to us the visit to the sepulcher of 
Mary Magdalen and the other Mary at the dawn of day. 
The Creed is not sung, as it used to be reserved for the second 
Mass which was sung later on Easter day. The kiss of peace 
is still omitted, for it was not until evening on the day of 
the Resurrection that Jesus stood in the midst of His apostles 
in the upper chamber in the holy city and gave them His 
peace. For the same reason the Agnus Dei is left out. 
When this Mass was appointed to be sung on the Saturday 
morning (instead of at the dawn of Easter day), it was 
necessary that it should be followed by Vespers. As the 
service is already so long, the Church bids us sing, immedi 
ately after the communion, Vespers containing one psalm 
and the Magnificat. This now takes the place of the post- 



7 1 8 Devotions in Honor of the Passion of Our Lord. 

communion in other Masses, and when these have been sung 
the Mass concludes with the blessing and the last Gospe 
according to St. John. 

EASTER SUNDAY. 
The Fruits o] the Passion. 

HEN Easter comes we must not forget the Passion 
* of Jesus. The Church reminds us of it every day 
in holy Mass. Jesus Himself appeared in heaven as a lamb 
that had been slain. Only we have now to look to the 
joyful side of the Passion, to its glorious fruits. 

1. The first fruit of the Passion is the exaltation of the 
Man-Christ Jesus to sit on the right hand of God. In Him 
our human nature received divine honors, and these honors 
were won by the sufferings of the Passion. "For the joy 
that was set before Him He endured the cross, and sitteth 
on the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. xii. 2). 

2. The second fruit of the Passion is the saving from sin 
and eternal death all those who choose to avail themselves 
of the grace offered them. "He shall see a long-lived seed." 
Millions, who otherwise would have dwelt for ever in the 
abyss of hell, are, through the graces won for them by Our 
Lord in His sacred Passion, the happy denizens of heaven 
to all eternity. It is this which will constitute the chief 
glory of the sacred humanity. 

3. The third fruit of the Passion is the crushing of Satan 
and all the company of hell beneath the feet of Jesus. Never 
was there so glorious a victory under the guise of defeat, 
never a more complete or unexpected triumph. He who 
wa^ in His Passion an object of derision to devils and wicked 
men, carne forth, in His Resurrection, King of kings and 
Lord of lords, triumphant over sin and death, before Whom 
every knee shall bow in heaven and in earth and hell. Thanks 
be to God for the unspeakable glory of the Passion of Jesus 
Christ! 

Prayers for Easter. 

1_|*LL the days of the mortal life of Jesus Christ, previous to 
&amp;lt;sJr-*-* that of His Resurrection, were, according to St. Paul, the 
days of His humiliation; whereas, Easter Sunday is properly 
called the clay of His glory; since it was by His Resurrection 
that the seal of heaven was affixed to His doctrine, His other 
miracles confirmed, His mission proved, and all His labors 
crowned. Hence arises the joy of the Church on this, the great 
est of her festivals.

HYMN FOR EASTER SUNDAY. 
O Filii et Filiaz. 

E sons and daughters of the Lord! 
The King of glory, King adored, 
This day Himself from death restored. 



All in the early morning gray 
Went holy women on their way, 
To see the tomb where Jesus lay. 

Of spices pure a precious store 

In their pure hands those women bore, 

To anoint the sacred body o er. 

Then straightway one in white they see, 
Who saith, "Ye seek the Lord; but He 
Is risen, and gone to Galilee." 

This told they Peter, told they John ; 
Who forthwith to the tomb are gone 
But Peter is by John outrun. 



720 Devotions in Honor of the BlesseJ Virgin Mary. 

That self-same night, while, out of fear, 
The doors were shut, their Lord most dear 
To His apostles did appear. 

But Thomas, when of this he heard, 
Was doubtful of his brethren s word ; 
Wherefore again there comes the Lord. 

"Thomas, behold My side," saith He; 
"My hands, My feet, My body see, 
And doubt not, but believe in Me." 

When Thomas saw that wounded side, 

The truth no longer he denied ; 

"Thou art my Lord and God!" he cried. 

Oh, blest are they who have not seen 
Their Lord, and yet believe in Him! 
Eternal life awaiteth them. 

Now 1 .et us praise the Lord most high, 

And strive His name to magnify 

On this great day, through earth and sky: 

Whose mercy ever runneth o er ; 
Whom men and angel hosts adore ; 
To Him be glory evermore.

H&amp;gt;ev&amp;gt;otions in Ibonor of tbe JSlesseD 



IReflecttons of a TRcltgious on Devotion to ur Xaog.* 

BEHOLD thy Son. . . Behold thy Mother" (John 
xix. 27). These were the last words that Jesus Christ 
addressed to any creature before His death; they are His 
last will. By them He intrusted all His disciples to His 
own beloved Mother as her spiritual children, and gave her 
to all His disciples as their spiritual Mother. These words 
have a special reference to Religious, who are represented 
by St. John, the beloved disciple of Our Saviour. He was 
a virginal soul, who had left all things for Christ s sake 
Religious vow and practice chastity, have left all things for 
Christ s sake, and have become His beloved spouses. No 
one else, then, has a greater claim to Mary as a Mother 

* From "Helps to a Spiritual Life." 



Devotions in Honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 721 

Religious may then say, Mary, in fact, has been truly 
our Mother, and the most tender of mothers, for we may, 
indeed, say, "All good things came to me together with her, 
and innumerable riches through her hands, for she is an 
infinite treasure to men; which they that use, become the 
friends of God" (Wisd. vii. n, 14). We owe everything to 
Mary. It is through her that we received all the graces 
bestowed on us whilst we were in the world, and particu 
larly the inestimable grace of our vocation. How many 
times did she not preserve us from danger, how many times 
did she not obtain for us victory over the allurements and 
temptations of the world! It was she who obtained for us 
the strength and heroism requisite to leave the world, to 
renounce its pleasures, to give up our own will. We can 
easily remember how she helped us when we invoked her, 
how she consoled and encouraged us in our trials. But 
what favors has she not conferred on us since the day on 
which we were consecrated and espoused to her divine Son! 
Without her help we could never have practiced the virtues 
required of Religious humility, self-denial, obedience, meek 
ness, and charity. Without her we could not have over 
come our many temptations, borne our numerous little 
trials. We could not have persevered until now in our 
holy vocation, had we not been a:isted by the Mother of 
perseverance. 

And had we been more loving and devoted children to 
her, had we more promptly invoked her, more fervently 
prayed to her, and more faithfully honored her, we should 
not have committed so many faults, or be now so full of 
imperfections and so devoid of virtue. 

We claim Mary as our Mother, and boast of being her 
children. But to be truly her children, we should bear 
some resemblance to her. As she is our spiritual Mother, 
her spiritual features, that is, her virtues, should be delineated 
in us, should be visible in our conduct. In the first place, 
we should resemble her in humility. Although she was the 
holiest and most perfect and most exalted of creatures, she 
excelled all in humility By her virginity, says the Church, 
Mary pleased God; but it was by her humility that she 
conceived the Son of God. "Without humility," says St. 
Bernard, "even Mary s spotless virginity would not have 
saved her." "Humility," says St. Teresa, "drew the Son 
of God from heaven into the womb of a virgin ; and it is 
only by a similar humility that we can draw Him into our 
souls." 

Secondly, Mary distinguished herself by her love of silence, 
recollection, retirement, and prayer. Her union with God 



722 Devotions in Hunur of the Blessed 1 irgm Mary. 

was constant and uninterrupted. Prayer was the food of 
her soul ; it was a second nature to her. Let us strive to 
imitate her in this, and especially in making our daily medita 
tion well. Thirdly, Mary was a model of obedience. Let us 
consider our Rules as the will of God toward us, and look 
upon the orders of our Superiors as the orders of God Him 
self. Fourthly, Mary w-as all aglow with divine love, and 
zealous for the salvation of mankind. Let us love no one 
out God, and allow in our heart no affection unless it be 
for God or in God, and, at the same time, let us be ready 
to sacrifice ourselves for the welfare and salvation of our 
neighbor in so far as obedience permits. In fine, Mary is 
the Queen of martyrs the Mother of sorrows, for next to 
Jesus, no one ever suffered so much and so willingly and 
patiently as Mary. Let us, like her, accept all sufferings, 
all trials and crosses, with patience and resignation, as sent 
to us by God out of love for us. 

Let us ask Mary, our Mother, Our Lady of Perpetual 
Help, the Mother of mercy, the Mother of perseverance, 
to help us faithfully to keep our good resolutions, to help 
us to imitate her virtues. Let us entreat her, by the love 
she bears to our Spouse Jesus, by the love she bears to us 
her children, to help us to resemble her, to become her true 
and worthy children. She who is the most loving of mothers 
can not refuse a prayer so pleasing to her a prayer which 
she can easily grant us, for she is all-powerful with her divine 
Son. He can not refuse anything to her who bore Him, 
whom He loved, honored, and obeyed on earth as His Mother, 
and whom He has exalted in heaven above all creatures. 
Let us in all our sorrows, in all our trials and sufferings, and 
especially in all our temptations and dangers, have recourse 
to her with the utmost fervor, love, and confidence, for she, 
the most powerful and tender of mothers, will obtain for us 
all we ask through her. "In all your wants," says the 
holy Redemptorist, Blessed Clement Maria Hofbauer, "turn 
to the Blessed Virgin. She is the Mother of mercy, and will 
obtain mercy for you from her Son. Never has the Son 
refused His Mother a grace, for He can not turn away a prayer 
of His Mother. She has found, and always will find, grace 
with God." "He who remembers," says St. Alphonsus, 
"having, in temptations against chastity, invoked the name 
of Mary, may rest assured of not having given consent to 
them." 

We should daily honor Mary in a special manner, and 
pray much and often to her. We can never honor her too 
much, whom God has so greatly honored. We ought, more 
over, to do all in our power to inspire others with devotion 



Devotions in Honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 723 

to her, with a tender love for her and an unlimited confi 
dence in her intercession. We ought to consider our devo- 
tion to Mary as our protection, as the surest means of sal 
vation and sanctification, and as a pledge of life everlasting, 
because she never forsakes those who are devout to her. 
"If you persevere until death," says St. Alphonsus, "in 
true devotion to Mary, your salvation is assured. " 

CONSECRATION TO MARY, OUR MOTHER. 

For Religious. 

OMOST holy and immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother 
of Jesus, my beloved Spouse, I now again choose 
thee as my own Mother. Henceforth I will never cease to 
love, cherish, and venerate thee as my own beloved Mother 
all the days of my life. To thee will I have recourse in all 
my trials, sufferings, and temptations, and I shall do my 
best to induce others to love and venerate thee, and to in 
voke thee in all their wants. O Mary, deign to accept me 
as thine own most loving child, and make rne faithful to 
thee. Make me, like thee, humble, meek, patient, charitable, 
pure, obedient, and docile to my Rules and Superiors. Deign 
to obtain for me an unwavering love for my Spouse, Jesus, 
and a holy and well-regulated zeal for the salvation of souls. 
O Mary, my dearest Mother, do not forsake me, thy child, 
when I am assailed by temptation; hasten then at once to 
my assistance, and do not permit me ever to prove untrue 
to my beloved Jesus. Enable me, by thy all-powerful help, 
to become, through a constant growth in virtue and holiness, 
daily more and more pleasing to Jesus, my heavenly Spouse, 
and to persevere until death in the love of Him and of thee, 
my most tender and beloved Mother Mary. Amen. 

PRAYER TO THE HEART OF MARY, MOTHER OF GOD AND OUR 
MOTHER. 

ART of Mary, Mother of God, our Mother; heart most 
amiable; delight of the ever-adorable Trinity, and 
worthy of all the veneration and tenderness of angels and 
of men ; heart most like the Heart of Jesus, whose most per 
fect image thou art ; heart full of goodness, ever compassion 
ate toward our miseries! vouchsafe to thaw our icy hearts, 
and change them to the likeness of the Heart of Jesus. 
Infuse into them the love of thy virtues, inflame them with 
that blessed fire with which thou dost ever burn. In thee 
let the holy Church find safe shelter ; be thou its guardian and 
its ever-sweet asylum, its tower of strength, impregnable 
against the assaults of its enemies. Be thou the road leading 
to Jesus; be thou the channel whereby we receive all graces

needful for our salvation. Be tliou our help in need, our 
comfort in trouble, our strength in temptation, our refuge 
in persecution, our aid in danger; but especially in the-last 
struggle of our life at the moment of our death, when all 
hell shall be unchained against us to snatch away our souls, 
in that dread moment, that hour so terrible, on which de 
pends our eternity ah! then, most tender Virgin, do thou 
make us feel how great is the sweetness of thy Mother s 
heart, how great thy power with the Heart of Jesus, opening 
to us, in the very fount of mercy itself, a safe refuge, that 
so one day we too may join with thee in paradise in praising 
the Heart of Jesus for ever and for ever. Amen. 

Act of Praise to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

of Mary be known, praised, blessed, loved, worshipped,

OMOST holy Mother, Queen of sorrows, who didst 
follow thy beloved Son through all the way of the 
cross, and whose heart was pierced with a fresh sword of 
grief at all the stations of that most sorrowful journey; obtain 
for us, we beseech thee, O most loving Mother, a perpetual 
remembrance of our blessed Saviour s cross and death, and 
a true and tender devotion to all the mysteries of His most 
holy Passion; obtain for us the grace to hate sin, even as 
He hated it in the agony in the garden; to endure wrong 
and insult with all patience, as He endureth them in the 
judgment-hall; to be meek and humble in all our trials, as 
He was before His judges; to love our enemies even as He 
loved His murderers, and prayed for them upon the cross; 
and to glorify God and do good to our neighbors, even as He 
did in every mystery of His sufferings. O Queen of martyrs, 
who, by the dolors of thy immac ulate heart on Calvary, didst 
merit to share the Passion of our blessed Redeemer, obtain 
for us some portion of thy compassion, that for the love of 
Jesus crucified, we may be crucified to the world in this life;

PRAYERS IN HONOR OF OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL HELP. 
I. 

O MOTHER of perpetual help! grant that I may ever 
invoke thy most powerful name, which is the safe 
guard of the living and the salvation of the dying. O 
purest Mary! O sweetest Mary! let thy name henceforth 



Devotions in Honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 747 

be ever on my lips. Delay not, O blessed Lady! to succor 
me, whenever I call on thee; for, in all my temptations, 
in all my needs, I shall never cease to call on thee, ever 
repeating thy sacred name, Mary, Mary. O what consola 
tion, what sweetness, what confidence, what emotion fills 
my soul when I utter thy sacred name, or even only think 
of thee! I thank the Lord for have given thee, for my good, 
so sweet, so powerful, so lovely a name. But I will not be 
content with merely uttering thy name. Let my love for 
thee prompt me ever to hail thee, Mother of perpetual help. 

II. 

O MOTHER of perpetual help! thou art the dispenser 
of all the gifts which God grants to us miserable sin 
ners; and for this end He has made thee so powerful, so 
rich, and so bountiful, in order that thou mayest succor us 
in our misery. Thou art the advocate of the most wretched 
and abandoned sinners who have recourse to thee: come to 
my help; I commend myself to thee. In thy hands I place 
my eternal salvation, and to thee I intrust my soul. Count 
me among thy most devoted servants; take me under thy 
protection, and it is enough for me. For, if thou protect 
me, I fear nothing; not from my sins, because thou wilt 
obtain for me the pardon of them; nor from the devils, 
because thou art more powerful than all hell together; nor 
even from Jesus, my Judge, because by one prayer from thee 
He will be appeased. But one thing I fear; that, in the 
hour of temptation, I may through negligence fail to have 
recourse to thee, and thus perish miserably. Obtain for 
me, therefore, the pardon of my sins, love for Jesus, final 
perseverance, and the grace ever to have recourse to thee, 
O Mother of perpetual help. 

PRAYER TO OUR LADY OF LOURDES. 

OEVER immaculate Virgin, Mother of mercy, Health

of Lourdes, thou wert pleased to make it a privileged sanctu 
ary, whence thou didst dispense thy favors, and already many 
sufferers have obtained the cure of their infirmities, both 
spiritual and corporal. I come, therefore, with the most 
unbounded confidence, to implore thy maternal intercession. 
Obtain, O loving Mother, the grant of my requests. Through 
gratitude for thy favors, I will endeavor to imitate thy virtues, 
that I may one day share thy glorv. Amen.

PRAYER OF A RELIGIOUS TO MARY. 

If Mary so loves the faithful, how must she not love Re 
ligious who have sacrificed their liberty, their life, their all 
for the love of Jesus Christ! 

OST amiable, loving, and beloved Queen, I render 
thee continual thanks, as also to my Saviour, 
for having taken me out of the world and called me to 
this Order, where devotion to thee is singularly held in 
honor and practiced. Take me into thy service, O 
my tender Mother; miserable though I be, yet refuse 
me not a place among the many souls thou boldest dear. 
After God, thou shalt always be my hope and my love. 
In all my needs, in all my trials, in all my temptations, 
it is to thee that I will always have recourse as my 
refuge and my consolation. I wish for naught but 
God and thee to support me in the struggles and sorrows 
of life. I renounce all else, preferring to serve thee 
rather than to reign over the whole world. For me, 
to reign means to serve, love, and bless thee on 
earth, my sweetest sovereign; for as St. Anselm says,

serving thee is reigning. Mother of perseverance, 
obtain for me the grace of being faithful to thee until 
death, faithful in my vows, faithful in imitating thy 
virtues, and thus I hope to arrive one day in thy glori 
ous dwelling: there will I kneel at thy feet, to praise 
thee, and thank thee for thy goodness and mercy. 
Jesus and Mary! Sweet objects of my love; for you 
will I labor and suffer; may I serve you in life, may I 
bless you, and love you for ever. 

O dearest Mother, pray for me, that I may one day 
be united in heaven with thy divine Son, Who has re 
deemed me by His precious blood. 

When my soul shall leave this world and all its perish 
able goods, to appear before the judgment-seat of thy 
divine Son, then, O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin 
Mary, intercede with Him for me, that He may be to 
me a Saviour and not a Judge. 

Oh, do thou thyself present my soul before the throne 
of Jesus, that I may see Him face to face, adore and 
love Him for ever, Whom I now adore here in the Most 
Holy Sacrament. Amen. 

THE THIRTY DAYS PRAYER TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY, 
In Honor of the Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. 

It is particularly recommended as a proper devotion for every 
day in Lent, and on all Fridays throughout the year. 

^fVER-GLORIOUS and Blessed Virgin, Queen of virgins, 
V_&amp;gt;\ Mother of mercy, hope and comfort of dejected souls, 
through that sword of sorrow which pierced thy tender 
heart, whilst thine only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, suffered 
death and ignominy on the cross; through that filial tender 
ness and pure love He had for thee, grieving in thy grief, 
whilst from His cross He recommended thee to the care 
and protection of His beloved disciple, St. John: take pity, 
we beseech thee, on our poverty and necessities; have com 
passion on our anxieties; assist and comfort us in all our 
infirmities and miseries. Thou art the Mother of mercies, 
the sweet consolatrix and refuge of the desolate and afflicted : 
look, therefore, with pity on us, miserable children of Eve, 



Devotions in Honor of the Blessed Virgin j\Iary. 751 

and hear our prayer: for since, in just punishment of our 
sins, we are encompassed by evils, whither can we fly for 
more secure shelter than to thy maternal protection? At 
tend, therefore, with an ear of pity, we beseech thee, to our 
humble and earnest request. We ask it through the mercy 
of thy dear Son, and through the love and condescension 
wherewith He embraced our nature, when, in compliance 
with the divine will, thou gavest thy consent, and Whom, 
after the expiration of nine months, thou didst bring forth 
from thy chaste womb to visit this world, and bless it with 
His presence. We ask it through the anguish of mind 
wherewith thy beloved Son, our dear Saviour, was over 
whelmed on Mount Olivet, when He besought His eternal 
Father to remove from Him, if possible, the bitter chalice 
of His future Passion. \Ve ask it through the threefold 
repetition of His prayer in the garden, from whence after 
wards, with mournful tears, thou didst accompany Him to 
the doleful theater of His sufferings and death. We ask it 
through the welds and sores of His virginal flesh, occasioned 
by the cords and whips wherewith He was bound and scourged 
when stripped of His seamless garment, for which His execu 
tioners afterwards cast lots. We ask it through the scoffs 
and ignominies by \\hich He was insulted, the false accusa 
tions and unjust sentence by which He was condemned to 
death, and which He bore with heavenly patience. We ask 
it through His bitter tears and sweat of blood, His silence 
and resignation, His sadness and grief of heart. We ask 
it through the blood which trickled from His royal and 
sacred head, when struck with the scepter of a reed and 
pierced with His crown of thorns. We ask it through the 
torments He endured, when His hands and feet were fastened 
with gross nails to the tree of the cross. We ask it through 
His vehement thirst and bitter potion of vinegar and gall. 
We ask it through His dereliction on the cross, when He 
exclaimed: "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken 
Me?" We ask it through His mercy extended to the good 
thief, and through His recommending His precious soul 
into the hands of His eternal Father before He expired, 
saying: "All is consummated." We ask it through the 
blood mixed with water which issued from His sacred side 
when pierced with a lance, and whence a flood of grace and 
mercy hath flowed to us. We ask it through His immacu 
late life, bitter Passion, and ignominious death upon the 
cross, at which nature itself was thrown into convulsions, 
by the bursting of rocks, rending of the veil of the Temple, 
the earthquake, and darkness of the sun and moon. We 



752 Devotions in Honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 

ask it through His descent into hell, where He comforted 
the saints of the Old Law, and led captivity captive. We 
ask it through His glorious victory over death, His triumphant 
Ascension into heaven, and through the grace of the Holy 
Ghost, infused into the hearts of the disciples when He 
descended on them in the form of fiery tongues. We ask 
it through His awful appearance on the last day, when He 
shall come to judge the living and the dead, and shall destroy 
the world by fire. We ask it through the compassion He 
bore thee, and the ineffable joy thou didst feel at thine 
assumption into heaven, where thou art absorbed in the 
sweet contemplation of His divine perfections. O glorious 
and ever-blessed Virgin, comfort the hearts of thy supplicants, 

by obtaining for us .* And as we are persuaded that 

our divine Saviour honors thee as His beloved Mother, to 
whom He can refuse nothing, so let us experience the efficacy 
of thy powerful intercession, according to the tenderness 
of thy maternal affection, and the charity of His amiable 
Heart, which mercifully granteth the requests, and complieth 
with the desires of those who love and fear Him. O most 
Blessed Virgin! besides the object of our present petition, 
and whatever else we may stand in need of, obtain for us 
of thy dear Son, Our Lord and Our God, lively faith, firm 
hope, perfect charity, true contrition, a horror of sin, love 
of God and our neighbor, contempt of the world, and patience 
and resignation under the trials and difficulties of this life. 
Obtain for us, also, O sacred Mother of God ! the gift of final 
perseverance, and the grace to receive the last Sacraments 
worthily at the hour of death. Lastly, obtain, we beseech 
-hee, for our parents, relatives, our Sisters in Religion, and 
our benefactors, whether living or dead, life everlasting. 
Amen.

the mantle of thy protection, thou who art the Mother of 
mercy! And since thou hast so much power with God, 
deliver me from all temptations, or at least obtain for me 
the grace ever to overcome them. From thee I ask a true 
love of Jesus Christ, and the grace of a happy death. O my 
Mother! by thy love for God I beseech thee to be at all 
times my helper, but above all at the last moment of my life. 
Leave me not until thou seest me safe in heaven, there for

THE REMEMBER OF OUR LADY OF THE SACRED HEART.* 

A Most Efficacious Prayer. 

EMEMBER, O Our Lady of the Sacred Heart! the 
unlimited power that thou possessest over the Heart 
of thy adorable Son. Full of confidence in thy merits, I 
come to implore thy protection. O sovereign Mistress of 
the Heart of Jesus! of that Heart which is the inexhaustible 
source of all graces, and which thou canst open at thy pleasure, 
and cause all the treasures of love and mercy, of light and 
salvation, that this Heart incloses, to descend upon man, 
grant me ; I conjure thee, the favor I solicit. No, I can not 
bear a refusal, and because thou art my Mother, O Our 
Lady of the Sacred Heart! favorably receive my prayer, 
and vouchsafe to grant my petition. Amen. 

AN ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE MOST HOLY HEART OF MARY. 

O HEART of Mary, ever Virgin! O heart the holiest, the 
purest, the most perfect, that the Almighty hath 
formed in any creature; O heart, full of all grace and sweet 
ness, throne of love and mercy, image of the adorable Heart 
of Jesus, heart that didst love God more than all the sera 
phim, that didst procure more glory to the most holy Trinity 
than all the saints together, that didst endure for love of us 
the bitter dolors at the foot of the cross, and dost so justly 
merit the reverence, love, and gratitude of all mankind, I 
give thee thanks for all the benefits which thou hast obtained 
for me from the divine Mercy; I unite myself to all the souls 
that find their joy and consolation in loving and honoring 
thee. O heart most amiable, the delight and admiration 
of the angels and the saints, henceforth thou shalt be to me, 
next to the Heart of Jesus, the object of my tenderest devo 
tion, my refuge in affliction, my consolation in sorrow, my 
place of retreat from the enemies of my salvation, and, at 
the hour of my death, the surest anchor of my hope. Amen.

Comments on tbe IRubrfcs of tbe ffice of tbe

E Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary is of ancient 
usage in the Church. It was recited by the clergy 
and devout laity, and practiced by rule in religious mon 
asteries, even, from the sixth and seventh centuries, and 
probably at a more early period. There is at least suffi 
cient historical evidence to prove that a liturgical form of 
prayer in honor of Our Lady is of very early times. 

This Office was instituted by the Church, guided by the 
Spirit of God, and is divided into seven canonical hours, 
according to the following order, set down in the Roman 
Breviary: ist, Vespers; 2d, Compline; 3d, Matins with 
Lauds; 4th, Prime; 5th, Tierce; 6th, Sext; and jth, None. 
These canonical terms should be adopted in naming the 
hours. 

As a rule, in the recitation of the Little Office of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary the Antiphons of the Psalms are announced 
in the manner that is proper to an Office of simple rite, i.e., 
the first words (preceding the asterisk) only of the Antiphons 
are said before the Psalms, but the entire Antiphon is re 
cited after the Psalms. 

There is, however, an exception to this rule, though this 
fact seems to be commonlv overlooked, and therefore we 
have printed the Antiphons in full both before and after the 
Psalms. Ordinarily, indeed, the Office being of a simple 
rite, only the first words of the Antiphons are said before the 
Psalms. 

But on certain occasions the Antiphons are recited as of 
double rite, i.e., all the Antiphons to the Psalms and Can 
ticles have to be said in full before and after, as appears 
from the following decree of the Roman Congregation, 
dated February 27, 1883. 

This is a reply to some dubia, which were submitted to 
the Congregation of Sacred Rites by a Sisterhood in the dio 
cese of Rennes: 

The hymn Te Deum must be said in the Little Office 
of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Christmas until Septua- 
gesima, and from Easter until Advent; but in Advent and 
from Septuagesima until Easter, only on the Feasts of the 
Blessed Virgin. 

In Choro, on those days on which feasts of double rite 
are celebrated, the Antiphons for Matins, Lauds, and Ves 
pers are to be doubled, i.e., said entire before and after the 



Ojjficium Parvum Bealce Maria Virginis. 757 

Psalms, whenever the Office is recited in full, viz., with 
three Nocturns. If, however, only one Nocturn is recited 
on festa duplicia, the Antiphons must not be doubled. 
The Latin text of this decree reads as follows: 
"In Officio parvo B. M. V. recitari debet Te Deum a Nativi- 
tate Domini usque ad Septuagesimam, et a Dominica Resurrec- 
tionis usque ad Adventum; in Adventu autem et a Septuagesima 
usque ad Pascha nonnisi in festis B. M. V. 

"In Choro diebus, quibus celebrantur festa duplicia, Anti- 
phonae ad Matutinum, Laudes et Vesperas duplicanda sunt, 
si officium recitetur integrum, i.e., cum t-ribus Nocturnis, non 
vero si unum tantum Nocturnum recitetur." 

CEREMONIAL.* 

" I ET all things be done decently and according to order, " 
&amp;lt;-* * says St. Paul (i Cor. xiv, 40). The use of cere 
monial is toward this end, and is inspired by the spirit 
of reverence. In the following we offer suggestions, based 
upon the practices of well-organized Communities, which 
have been found to answer. 

(1) At the sound of the bell the Community meet at 
some place outside the chapel, and form into two ranks, 
the youngest nearest the entrance, the Superior last. At 
the given signal they enter the choir, two and two, and, after 
genuflecting, proceed to their respective stalls. 

(2) Kneeling, they say silently the introductory prayer. 

(3) When the Superior gives the signal (by a tap on the 
desk) they rise, and bowing profoundly (so that the tips of 
fingers may touch the knees), say in silence the A-ve Maria, 

(4) At the signal, all turning eastward (i.e., toward the 
altar), the Superior, or the Hebdomadary, that is, the one 
who for the week conducts the service, begins Domine labia 
mea aperies, making a sign of the cross upon the lips; then, 
Deus in adjutorium meum intende, making the large sign of 
the cross. 

(5) At the Gloria all turn, facing each other, and bow pro 
foundly. 

(6) Then the first Cantor goes into the middle to the 
Lectern and commences the Invitatory, to which both 
sides of the choir respond. The Psalm is said by the Can 
tor. On the greater festivals two Cantors should be used. 

"(7) In the third verse, at the words Venite adoremus, all 
kneel til? the words Nos autem, when they rise for the repe 
tition of the Invitatory. 

(8) The first line of the hymn is given out by the first 

* Vide Taunton s " Little Office of Our Lady." 



758 Officium. Parvum Beata Maria Virginis, 

Cantor and the rest of the verse is taken up by his side of 
the choir; then the second choir take up the second verse, 
and so on, both choirs joining in and bowing profoundly 
for the last verse. 

(9) The Antiphon is given out by the first Cantor, and 
also the Psalm up to the asterisk, then all his side of the 
choir take it up. At the end the Cantor repeats the Anti 
phon, and the second Cantor from the other side begins the 
second Antiphon and Psalms. 

(10) While the Psalms are being said the choir can re- 
chne in their stalls or sit down. 

(n) A short pause ought to be made just after the last 
verse, and all, rising and bowing profoundly, say the Gloria 
Patri. 

N.B. This always takes place before the Gloria Patri 
whenever said at the end of a Psalm. 

(12) The Psalms over, all rise; the first Cantor says the 
Versicle, to which all respond. 

. (13) The Supeiior, or Hebdomadary, says Pater Nosier 
aloud, then all, bowing, continue it in secret till Et ne nos, 
which is said by the Superior aloud, and all, rising, make 
the answer. 

(14) The Superior then gives the absolution. 

(15) The Reader goes to the Lectern and after genuflect 
ing turns, bowing toward the Superior, and says Jube do- 
mine. After the blessing, given by the Superior, to which 
ail reply A men, the choir sits while the Reader reads the 
Lesson. 

(16) At the end of the Lesson the choir, started by the 
Cantor, say the Responsory; but the Yersicle is said by 
the Reader, who having said it retires to his place, w-hile the 
next one in order comes out to read the second Lesson. 

(17) The Superior, or Hebdomadary, ought to read in his 
place the third Lesson, during which, if it be the Superior, 
all stand out of respect. 

(18) The Lessons over, the Te Deum is started by the 
Cantor, all rising and facing eastward. 

(19) At the Te ergo all kneel, facing one another, rising at 
the next verse. 

(20) If Matins is not followed at once by Lauds after the 
Te Deum the Versicle, Domine exaudi orationem, with the 
Prayer from Lauds and the concluding Versicles, are said. 
Otherwise 

AT LAUDS. 

(i; All turning toward the altar, the Superior or Heb 
domadary begins, making the sing of the cross, Deus in 



Ojficium Parvum Beattz Mar is, Virginis. 759 

adjutorium. At the Gloria all turn, facing one another, 
and bowing, profoundly, say the Gloria Patri. 
N.B. This ceremonial is used at all the hours. 

(2) The first Cantor starts the first Antiphon and Psalm 
and repeats the former at the end, and so with the third 
and fifth. 

(3) The second Antiphon and Psalm are started by the 
second Cantor, and so with the fourth. 

(4) During the Psalms in this and all other hours the 
choir recline in their stalls or sit, as the custom may be. 
The former for preference. 

(5) If it is found that the reciting note is lowered after 
several Psalms, at the Laudate it will be well for the first 
Cantor to raise the pitch when giving out the Antiphon. 

(6) The Psalmody over, all rise and face eastward while 
the Superior, or the Hebdomadary, says the Little Chapter, 
to which all answer, Deo Gratias. Then, all turning face- 
ways, the first Cantor gives out the first line of the hymn 
and all his side continue it. The second verse is said by 
the opposite choir, and all bow during the last verse. 

(7) The Yersicle is said by the Cantor, and all make the 
Response. 

(8) Then lie starts the Antiphon and the Benedictus. 

(9) At the Canticle, which is to be said more solemnly 
than the rest of the Office, all turn eastwards and make the 
sign of the cross. 

N.B. This is done at the three Canticles. The Gloria is 
said as usual. 

(10) After the repetition by the Cantor of the Antiphon, 
the first Cantor s side start Kyrie eleison, to which the second 
Cantor s side respond Christe eleison, both sides joining in 
the last invocation. Then the Superior, or Hebdomadary, 
says the Versicles, to which all respond, and the prayer, 
during which all except the reciter bow profoundly, rising 
to answer Amen. Then follows the Commemoration. All 
say the Antiphon; the Cantor follows with the Versicle, 
to which all respond; the Superior, or other, recites the 
prayer. 

(u) After the concluding Versicles, all bow while saying 
together in secret the Pater, rising for the Dominus del 
nobis. 

(12) All then kneel (except from Saturday Vespers until 
after Sunday s Compline and during Paschal time, when all 
remain standing, but facing eastwards) for the Antiphon 
of Our Lady, which being over, after a few moments private 
prayer, all retire as they entered. Having arrived at the 
appointed place (called the statio) the Superior passes througn 



760 Offidum Parvum Beats Maria Virginis. 

the ranks and turning, salutes each side, and then all depart 
in peace. 

THE LITTLE HOURS. 

(1) These are said in the same way. 

(2) The Hymn comes before the Psalms. 

VESPERS. 

(1) All as at Lauds, with the following exception. 

(2) In the second Psalm all bow while saying the Sit 
nomen Domini benedictum. 

(3) All kneel for the first verse of the Ave Maris Stella. 

COMPLINE. 

(1) The Con-verte is said turned eastwards, toward the altar. 

(2) The rest of the Office as above. 

(3) The Superior gives the final blessing, during which 
sll bow profoundly. 

(4) The Antiphon of Our Lady follows at once.

Blessed be the name of 
the Lord, from this time

From the rising of the sun

The Lord is high above all 
nations; and His glory is 
above the heavens.

Who raise th up the needy 
from the earth, and lifteth

That He may set him with

princes of His people. 

Who maketh the barren 
woman dwell in her house the 
joyful mother of children.

PSALM CXXVIII. 

OFTEN have they fought 
against me from my 
youth; let Israel now say. 

Often have they fought 
against me from my youth; 
but they could not prevail 
against me. 

The wicked have wrought 
upon my back: they have 
prolonged their iniquity. 

The just Lord hath hewn 

asunder the necks of sinners : 

let them all be confounded 

and turned back that hate 

Sion. 

Let them be as grass of 
the housetops, which withcr- 
eth before it be plucked up. 

Wherewith the mower fill- 
eth not his hand; nor he that 
gathereth the sheaves, his 
bosom. 

And they that pass by say 
not : The blessing of the Lord 
be upon you : we bless you in 
the name of the Lord. 

Glory be, etc. 

PSALM CXXIX. 

OUT of the depths have I 
cried unto Thee, O 
Lord. Lord, hear my voice. 

O let Thine ears be atten

If Thou, O Lord, wilt ob 
serve iniquities, Lord, who 
shall stand it? 

For with Thee there is 
merciful forgiveness; and by 
reason of Thy law I have 
waited for Thee, O Lord. 

My soul hath relied on His

do 1 wake at break of 
day. 

For Thee my soul thirsteth ; 
for Thee my flesh longeth, O 
how exceedingly! 

In a desert, pathless, and 
waterless land: so have I 
come before Thee in the holy 
place, that I might see Thy 
power and Thy glory. 

For Thy mercy is better 
than life: my lips shall 
praise Thee. 

Thus will I bless Thee all 
my life long; and in Thy 
name will I lift up my hands. 

Let my soul be rilled as 
with marrow and fatness; 
and my mouth shall praise 
Thee with joyful lips. 

If I have remembered Thee 
upon my bed, on Thee will I 
meditate in the morning; be 
cause Thou hast been my 
helper. 

And I will rejoice under 
the covert of Thy wings: my 
soul cleaveth unto Thee; 
Thy right hand upholdeth 
me. 

But they seek my soul in 
vain: they shall go" into the 
lower parts of the earth 
they shall be delivered into 
the power of the sword: 
they shall be portions for 
foxes. 

But the king shall rejoice 
in God, all they that swear 
by Him shall be praised:

CANTICLE OF ZACHARY. 

Luke i. 

BLESSED be the Lord 
God of Israel, because 
He hath visited and wrought 
the redemption of His people; 

And hath raised up a horn 
of salvation to us in the 
house of David His servant ; 

As He spoke by the mouth 
of His holy prophets, -who 
are from the beginning: 

Salvation from our enemies, 
and from the hand of all 
that hate us. 

To perform mercy to our 
fathers, and to remember 
His holy testament. 

The oath which He swore 
to Abraham our father, that 
He would grant to us, 

That being delivered from 
the hand of our enemies, we 
may serve Him without fear, 

In holiness and justice 
before Him all our days. 

And thou, child, shalt 
be called the prophet of 
the Highest; for thou shalt 
go before the face of the 
Lord to prepare His ways: 

To give knowledge of sal 
vation to His people, unto 
the remission of their sins; 

Through the bowels of 
the mercy of Our God, in 
which the Orient from on 
high hath visited us. 

To enlighten them that 
sit in darkness and in the 
shadow of death; to direct 
our feet into the way of 
peace. 

Glory be, etc.

Turn back evil upon mine 
enemies: and destroy them 
in Thy truth. 

I will freely sacrifice unto 
Thee, and will give thanks

Thou hast forgiven the 
iniquity of Thy people 
Thou hast covered all their 
sins. 

Thou hast softened all 
Thine anger: Thou hast 
turned away from the wrath 
of Thine indignation. 

Convert us, O God our 
Saviour; and turn away 
Thine anger from us. 

Wilt Thou be angry with 
us for ever: or wilt Thou 
stretch out Thy wrath from 
generation to generation? 

Thou wilt turn again, O 
God, and quicken us; and 
Thy people shall rejoice in 
Thee. 

Show us Thy mercy, O 
Lord; and grant us Thy sal 
vation. 

I will hearken what the 
Lord shall say within me; 
for He will speak peace unto 
His people. 

And unto His saints; and 
unto them that are con 
verted in heart. 

Surely His salvation is 
unto them that fear Him: 
that glory may dwell in our 
land. 

Mercy and truth have met 
together: justice and peace 
have kissed. 

Truth is sprung out of the 
earth ; and justice hath looked 
down from heaven. 

For the Lord shall give 
goodness ; and our earth shall 
yield her fruit. 

Justice shall walk before 
Him; and shall set His steps 
in the right way. 

Glory be, etc.

BESIDES the annual retreat, many Founders of Religious 
Orders have prescribed for the members of their 
Institutes other short retreats, destined to prepare them 
for the greater feasts, and at the same time to enable them 
to examine into the state of their souls. 

One day in the month is also fixed in most Religious 
Communities as a day of special recollection, and of the 
renewal of fervor and zeal in the service of God, by the 
most earnest consideration of Death and Eternity. 

In all stages of the spiritual life it is necessary for us to 
enter often into ourselves; if we are faithful, in order to per 
severe; if lukewarm, to reanimate ourselves; if unobservant, 
to re-enter upon the duties of exact observance. 

We are viatores travelers, journeying on toward our 
home. Love should spur us on to walk the steep, narrow, 
and rugged road that leads to eternal life to the happy 
home of the saints. But let us ponder over St. Ignatius 
prayer, that if love should fail, the fear of hell might help 
him not to offend God.

E&amp;gt;ou0bt6 from St. Blpbonsur en Pcatb anfr Btcrmtg. 

. Augustine was wont to call the thought of eternity 
the Great Thought. 

St. Teresa used to repeat to her spiritual daughters: 
"My children, one soul, one eternity!" She meant to say: 
My children, we have but one soul, and if that is lost, 
all is lost; and once lost, it is lost for ever." In a word, 
upon that last breath which we draw in dying depends 
our being either happy for ever, or for ever in despair. If 
the eternity of the next life, if paradise, if hell, were mere 
opinions of literary men, and things of doubtful reality, 
even then we ought to take even care to live well, and not 
run the risk of losing our soul for ever. But no; for these 
things are not doubtful; they are certainties, they are truths 
of faith; much more certain than the things which we see 
with the eyes of the body. 

Let us, then, pray to Our Lord to give us more faith, saying 
with the apostles: "Lord, increase our faith!" For, if 
we are not strong in faith, we may become worse than Luther 
or Calvin. On the contrary, one thought of lively faith 
in the eternity that awaits us, may make us saints. 

St. Gregory says that they who meditate on eternity are 
neither puffed up by prosperity, nor cast down by adversity; 
because as they desire nothing in the world, so they fear 
nothing from the world. 

When it happens to us to suffer any infirmities or persecu 
tions, let us remember the hell which we have deserved by 
our sins. When we do this, every cross will seem to us 
light, and we shall thank the Lord, and say: "It is the mercies 
of the Lord that we are not consumed" (Lam. iii. 22 &amp;gt;. 
Let us say with David, "Unless the Lord had been my 
helper, my soul had almost dwelt in hell" (Ps. xciii. 17, . 

I MUST OXE DAY DEE. 

is a practice very profitable for our eternal salvation, 
to say often to ourselves: "I must one day die." The 
most precious objects which wre carried by the 
anchorites to their caves were a cross and a skull: the cross 
to remind them of the love which Jesus Christ has had for 



872 Bona Mors Devotions. 

us, and the skull to remind them of the day of their own 
death. And thus they persevered in penitential works 
till the end of their days; and, dying in poverty in the deserts, 
they died more happy than kings who die in palaces. 

If, then, . we have faith, let us believe that there is a 
death, a judgment, an eternity; and endeavor, during the 
days that yet remain for us, to live only for God. And 
therefore let us take care to live as pilgrims on this earth, 
remembering that we must speedily leave it. Let us live 
with death ever before our eyes; and in all the affairs of 
this present life let us take care to act as we should act at 
the point of death. All things upon earth either leave us, 
or we have to leave them. Let us listen to Jesus Christ, 
Who says: "Lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven, 
where neither the rust nor moth doth consume" (Matt. 
vi. 20). O Lord, if I have been foolish in the past, I will 
not be foolish any longer. Now I give myself wholly to 
Thee; do Thou receive me, and help me with Thy grace. 



PREPARATION FOR DEATH. 

is certain. "It is appointed unto men once to 
die" (Heb, ix. 27). On the contrary, the time and 
the manner of our death are uncertain. Therefore Jesus 
Christ exhorts us: "Be you then also ready, for at what 
hour you think not, the Son of man will come" (Luke xii. 
40). He says: " Be you ready " ; therefore, to save our souls, 
it is not sufficient to prepare ourselves to die when death 
seems to be approaching, but we must then be already pre 
pared. It is accordingly useful for every one to repeat, at 
least once a month, the following acts. 

Behold me, O my God, ready to embrace that death 
which Thou dost destine for me. From this moment I 
accept it, and I sacrifice to Thee my life in honor of Thy 
divine Majesty, and also in penance for my sins, rejoicing that 
this my flesh, to please which I have offended Thee so much, 
should be devoured by worms, and be reduced to dust. O 
my Jesus, I unite the pains and the agony which I must 
then suffer to the pains and agony which Thou, my Saviour, 
didst suffer in Thy death; I accept death with all the cir 
cumstances Thou mayst appoint; I accept the time, whether 



Bona Mors Devotions, 873 

it be after many years, or very soon; I accept the manner, 
whether in bed or out of it, whether with warning or suddenly, 
and from that sickness more or less painful as it may please 
Thee. In everything I resign myself to Thy holy will. 
Give me strength to suffer all with patience.^ 

"What shall I render to the Lord for all the things that 
He hath rendered to me?" (Ps. cxv. 12.) I thank Thee, 

my God, first, for the gift of faith, protesting that I intend 
to die a child of the Holy Catholic Church. I thank Thee 
for not having caused me to die when I was in sin, and for 
having so often pardoned me with so much mercy. I thank 
Thee for so many lights and graces with which Thou hast 
sought to draw me to Thy love. I thank Thee for having 
called me to the Religious state. I pray Thee to let me 
die after receiving Thee in the holy Viaticum, so that, united 
to Thee , I may go to present myself at Thy tribunal. I do 
not deserve to hear from Thy mouth the words: "Well 
done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been 
faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things; 
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord " (Matt. xxv. 21). 

1 do not deserve it, for in nothing have I been perfectly 
faithful to Thee; but Thy death gives me hope that I shall 
be admitted to heaven, to love Thee eternally and with 
all my powers. 

O my crucified Love, have mercy upon me! Look upon 
me with that love with which Thou didst look upon me from 
the cross, when dying for me. "Remember not the sins 
of my youth and my ignorances, O Lord." My sins terrify 
me, but I am comforted by that cross on which I see Thee 
dead for the love of me. "Behold the wood of the cross, 
on which hung the salvation of the world." I desire to 
end my life, that I may cease from offending Thee. Oh, 
by the blood that was shed for me, do Thou pardon me all 
my sins before death comes upon me. O blood of the 
innocent One, wash away the stains of the guilty! 

My Jesus, I embrace Thy cross, and kiss the wounds 
of Thy sacred feet, before which I desire to breathe out 
my soul. Ah, do not abandon me at the last moment. 
"We beseech Thee, therefore, save Thy servants, whom 
Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood." I love 
Thee with all my heart, I love Thee more than myself. 



874 Bono. Mors Devotions. 

and I repent with all my soul that I have despised Thee in 
the past. O Lord, I was lost, but Thou in Thy goodness 
hast delivered me from the world; receive, then, my soul 
from this moment for the hour when it shall leave the earth. 
Therefore J pray to Thee with St. Agatha: "O Lord, Thou 
Who hast taken from me the love of this world, receive 
my soul." "In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; I shall not 
be confounded for ever; Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord 
the God of truth." 

O holy Virgin, succor me at the moment of my death. 
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a sinner, now 
and at the hour of my death; in thee, O Lady, have I hoped, 
I shall not be confounded for ever. St. Joseph, my pro 
tector, obtain for me a holy death. My guardian angel, 
St. Michael the archangel, defend me in that last conflict 
with hell. My holy patrons, and all ye saints of paradise, 
succor me in that last moment. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, 
be with me at the hour of my death. 

fterinfl of dBase ano Communion for the flfcontblg 
IRecol lection in preparation for Deatb. 

In connection with the Mass in honor of the Passion of Our 
Lord, the following prayers may be serviceable. 

OFFERING AT THE BEGINNING OF MASS. 

OMY God, I offer Thee this holy Mass this sublime 
sacrifice of adoration, thanksgiving, reparation, 
and prayer in union with the Passion of Our Lord and 
Saviour, Jesus Christ, and to obtain the grace of a happy 
death. 

Innumerable are the thanks I owe Thee, my dear Redeemer, 
for the sacrifice which Thou hast made of Thyself for me. 
I offer Thee my life in return; I offer it as a victim to honor 
Thee; may it be made worthy of Thy acceptance united 
with Thy death on the cross. Since love has made Thee die for 
me, it is but just that with a good will I accept of death 
for love of Thee. Had I a thousand lives, they would be 
too little to give Thee. I embrace death with joy; as it 
will free me from the possibility of offending Thee, I embrace 
it with resignation as the punishment due for my sins. I 



Bona Mors Devotions. 875 

accept it at the moment, in the place, and in the manner that 
Thou wiliest; let earth return to earth, but grant that my 
soul, created to Thy image and redeemed by Thy blood, may 
return unto Thee. I now humbly thank Thee for all Thy 
benefits, as I desire to do at the last moment of my life, 
and when in my agony I shall not be able to adore, thank, 
and praise Thee, my God, I desire still to be united to all 
those who in heaven and on earth adore, praise, and thank 
Thee. I offer Thee now, for that hour, my agonies, fears, 
and sufferings to be united to the bitter agony and dolorous 
sufferings of my dying Saviour, for the remission of my 
sins, for the eternal glory of the Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost, Whose name be for ever praised and whose will be 
for ever done, in me and by me for all eternity. 

MASS FOR THE FIRST SUNDAY. 

At the Offertory. 

BINCE death, O my God, is the punishment Thou 
ordainest for sin, it is with a humble and submis 
sive heart I accept Thy decree, I accept all the pains, 
trouble, and anxieties which are to accompany it, asking 
only a true spirit of resignation, an ardent love and desire 
to suffer all Thou mayest appoint, and sincere and heart 
felt contrition. Had I but once offended Thee, it were 
still too much; but I have multiplied my sins above the 
hairs of my head in eveiy place surrounded by Thy gifts, 
I have sinned: no day of my life which is not stained. Oh, 
that I were capable of an infinite sorrow to blot out all my 
sins! Accept, O Lord, in lieu of the grief that is wanting 
in me, the sorrow of my Saviour in the garden and upon 
the cross. If, dear Lord, I have often ceased to be 
Thy dutiful child, Thou hast never ceased to be my loving 
Father. All I can offer in satisfaction for my sins and 
ingratitude is my life, which I now offer with all my heart; 
at this very instant deprive me of it, if Thou wiliest 
I resign it unto Thee. Yet, O my God, I am full of fears, 
my sins being so great and Thy judgments so terrible; but 
are not Thy mercies greater than all? Should I not then 
confide in Thee with a firm hope? Yes, I cast myself into 
the abyss of Thy mercies. Had I but this moment to live 



876 Bona Mors Devotions. 

I would employ it in loving Thee. I fear not, under the 
cover of Thy mercy, insured to me by the blood of Jesus 
Christ, which He has shed for me, and which He is again 
about to offer on this altar. 

O dear Lord Jesus Christ, I recommend my soul into 
Thy hands: Thou hast bought it with Thy blood; it is 
Thine; I abandon it to Thy divine will, and to the judg 
ment Thou shalt pronounce upon it, confidently hoping 
that Thou wilt save what Thou hast loved unto death. 

After the Elevation. 

, Jesus, sacred Victim! Who, in the moment of 
Thy Incarnation, didst accept the bitter Passion 
and death prepared for Thee, I, in union with Thy holy 
and perfect sacrifice, accept whatever death Thou hast 
ordained for me. I desire that the last act of my liberty 
may be an act of obedience to Thy divine will, in union with 
Thy obedience when, bowing down Thy head, Thou didst 
render Thy pure soul into the hands of Thy eternal Father. 
With Thee, dear Jesus, may I say, All is consummated;" 
and may my soul, when freed from its earthly bonds, fly 
to the bosom of Thy love, and be received by Thee into 
the kingdom of Thy glory. 

At the Communion. 

Y Saviour! my Redeemer! my sovereign Love! 
come, take possession of my heart, sanctify my 
soul, and replenish it with Thy graces. Would that I 
could die now when I shall have received Thee, that, sepa 
rated from all earthly things, I might be for ever united to 
Thee. Jesus, my Jesus, be to me a Jesus, especially in 
my last hour, and fortify me in my departure out of this 
world against Thine enemies and mine; stay with me, O 
Lord, stay with me, for it is late, the best part of my life 
is gone by the evening comes on, the shadows of night 
approach. Oh, guide me safely through this vale of tears 
be my light amidst the shadows of death, be my hope and 
strength in my last struggle, and my reward for all eternity. 

Make an act of sincere contrition, a renewal of vows, and 
receive Jesus Christ as the viaticum of your soul. 



Eona Mors Devotions. 877 

Contrition. 

OMY God! I am heartily sorry for having offended 
Thee, and I detest my sins above every other evil, 
because they displease Thee, my God, Who, for Thy infinite 
goodness, art so deserving of all my love; and I firmly resolve, 
by Thy holy grace, never more to offend Thee, and to amend 
my life. 

CONSIDERATIONS AND RENEWAL OF VOWS. 

Prayer. 

BEHOLD me, O my God, prostrate at Thy sacred 
feet, penetrated with a profound fear of Thy judg 
ments and sorrow for my sins. Oh, cleanse my poor soul 
from its stains, and drown my imperfections in the bound 
less ocean of Thy mercy. Give me, O gracious Lord, true 
humility of spirit, that I may perfectly understand the abyss 
of my own nothingness, and rightly comprehend the im 
mensity of Thy goodness. Dispel my darkness, O all- 
knowing God, with Thy divine light: conduct my reason 
in the right way; confirm me in my good purpose of observ 
ing with renewed fervor and fidelity Thy holy law, my Rule 
and Vows. I consecrate to Thee the remainder of my life, 
and bequeath into Thy hands the spirit which Thou hast 
made from nothing. I bequeath it to Jesus Christ, my 
Saviour, Who redeemed it with His precious blood, and 
to the Holy Ghost, Who sanctified it at baptism, and espoused 
it to Himself at my holy profession, protesting that when 
in my last agony I shall be unable to employ my tongue 
in praying and praising Thy divine Majesty, I desire still 
in mind and heart to be firmly united to Thee, offering my 
agony to be united to the bitter agony and suffering death 
of my Jesus, for the remission of my sins, and for His eternal 
glory, Whose name be for ever glorified, Whose praises be 
for ever celebrated, and Whose will be for ever done on earth 
as it is done in heaven. 

O incomparable Virgin Mary! Mother of Jesus! Mother 
of mercy! and my Mother! I humbly and earnestly cry to 
chee to deliver me by thy prayers from the enemies of my 
soul, to obtain for me pardon and remission of my sins, 
and to assist me in the agonies of death. 

O heavenly spirits, holy angels, and saints, pray for me.

JESUS! divine Spouse of my soul, for me Thou hast 
just renewed the great sacrifice of Calvary. What 
return shall I make to Thee for this excess of love! Ah! I 
will also renew with all my heart the sacrifice I had the happi 
ness of offering Thee on the day of my profession. Again 
t will drive into my hands and feet the nails of my cherished 
vows of obedience, chastity, and poverty. I will consider 
myself this day as a victim unceasingly immolated to Thy 
Divine Heart, and I will accept in a spirit of love all the sac 
rifices demanded of me for the faithful observance of my 
vows and Rules, too happy to be able, even in a small degree 
to return Thee love for love sacrifice for sacrifice. Amen. 

HOW TO MAKE OUR MONTHLY RECOLLECTION, TOGETHER 
WITH THE PREPARATION FOR DEATH.* 

HE object of this pious exercise, which is usually made 
on the first or the last Sunday of every month, is, 
first, to discover, not only our faults, but their roots and 
sources also, and to examine whether we have made any 
progress in virtue ; secondly, to seek the necessary means of 
amendment and progress; and thirdly, to dispose our will 
to practice conscientiously our good resolutions. 

When thou art at leisure, go in the presence of the Blessed 
Sacrament, or else retire to thy room, kneel, and, according 
to the directions given in the following chapter, try to find 
put the state of thy soul, asking thyself and sincerely answer 
ing the following questions: 

r To what faults and sins am I mostly subject ? 

2. How have 1 kept and executed my good resolutions. 
What is the occasion or source of my want of fidelity? 

3. Have I a good intention in all my actions? Am I not 
led by human respect? Have I a particular affection or 
friendship for some one? 

4. Do I punctually, conscientiously, and fervently dis 
charge the duties of my office 5 

Keep a correct account of the faults thou now discoverest 
and compare it with that of the previous month. Excite 
a hearty sorrow for these faults, and, at the next occasion, 
confess the most important ones, and consult thy confessor 

* From "Helps to a Spiritual Life": Schneider-Girardey. 



Bona Mors Devotions. 879 

concerning them. At a visit to the Blessed Sacrament and 
at thy next holy communion offer thy resolutions to Our 
Lord, beg for grace to put them into practice, and recom 
mend thyself to the Blessed Virgin and to the saints of thy 
Order. 

MEDITATION ON THE PRESENT STATE OP OUR SOUL. 

BREPARATORY PRAYER. O my God, I firmly believe 
that Thou art here present, and I acknowledge that, 
because of my sins, I am wholly unworthy to appear in Thy 
holy presence. Trusting, nevertheless, in Thy infinite 
goodness and mercy, I venture to speak to Thee, to call 
upon Thy holy name, and to meditate on Thy teachings 
and commandments, in order always to know better and 
fulfil more faithfully Thy holy will. Enlighten, then, my 
understanding that I may discover what I should do or 
omit in order to promote my salvation, that I may, with 
my whole heart, repent of my sins and of my neglect and 
want of fidelity in Thy service, and resolve to perform all 
that Thou requirest of me. Grant me especially the grace 
to know Jesus Christ, my Redeemer and Guide, always 
better and better, so that I may love Him more ardently, 
and may, after His example, labor, combat, and suffer with 
generosity and self-sacrifice. 

First Prelude. Vividly imagine yourself standing before 
the throne of the divine Majesty. 

Second Prelude. Pray to God for light to appreciate tht&amp;gt; 
value of the graces and benefits hitherto received, and to 
acknowledge and repent of the malice of your past faults 
and sins, and to make appropriate resolutions. 

I. Point. Consider the benefits thou hast received this 
month (this week), and especially perseverance in thy voca 
tion, the numerous powerful means of perfection, thy daily 
spiritual exercises such as meditation, examens of con 
science, spiritual reading, visit to the Blessed Sacrament, 
the frequent reception of the sacraments, the constant 
watchfulness and direction of thy Superiors, the good ex 
ample of thy companions, the many divine inspirations, 
preservation from grievous sins, the diminution of the num 
ber of venial sins, the greater ease in overcoming tempta 
tions, a more ardent love of thy vocation, increased facility 
in overcoming the difficulties and obstacles of perfection. 
"It is true, the Lord is good, and His mercy endureth for 
ever. What shall I render to the Lord for all that He has 
rendered to me?"

II. Point, Investigate the present state of thy soul, and 
especially how thou hast conducted thyself and what care 
thou didst bestow on thy ordinary daily exercises. 

1. How hast thou behaved toward God 9 What courage, what 
desire didst thou feel and nourish in thyself for the attain 
ment x&amp;gt;f perfection ? How didst thou perform thy spiritual 
exercises? Didst thou experience therein greater devo 
tion and consolation than formerly, or, at least, didst thou 
show more zeal and endurance? Of didst thou rather 
experience desolation and dryness, or even relax in fervor 
and fidelity? In keeping thy vows and rules, was thy 
motive love or fear? Hast thou not failed to make that 
progress in perfection which, with God s help, thou couldst 
have made? Reflect on some special occasions of so doing 
which presented themselves to thee. 

2. What has been thy conduct tou ard thy Superiors ? Didst 
thou always endeavor to consider Jesus Christ Himself in 
the person of thy Superiors? Didst thou always show them 
due respect and love? Didst thou willingly, humbly, and 
perfectly obey thy Superiors of inferior rank? And this 
without murmur, without excuse, without pretexting diffi 
culties? Wert thou open-hearted and sincere toward thy 
Superior, or didst thou act deceitfully toward him? 

3. How hast thou conducted thyself toward thy companions 
in Religion ? Didst thou sincerely love them all and prefer 
them to thyself? Didst thou not wound fraternal charity 
and concord? Hast thou no particular affection for some 
one? Dost thou entertain an aversion for some one? Didst 
thou strive by true humility, simplicity, patience, discretion, 
love, and modesty to render thyself amiable before God and 
men ? Didst thou endeavor to preserve peace of heart ? 
Wast thou considerate in speech and in intercourse with 
others ? 

4. How hast thou fulfilled thy personal duties ? Didst thou 
love poverty as a mother? Didst thou cheerfully bear its 
privations? Wast thou always content to get the poorest 
in all things? Didst thou desire it? Didst thou exert 
thyself to preserve purity of body and soul? Didst thou 
at once strive to suppress all impure thoughts and repre 
sentations? Didst thou carefully watch over thy senses? 
Didst thou, without or against the will of thy Superiors, 
exceed in acts of exterior mortification, or show thyself 
negligent therein? 

Wast thou diligent and careful in thy daily duties ? Didst 
thou rise in the morning at the very first sound of the bell? 
Didst thou then at once raise thy thoughts to God, to the 
subject of thy particular examen, of thy meditation? Didst 



Bona Mors Devotions. 88 1 

thou endeavor to preserve recollection of mind ? Didst thou 
say thy morning prayers attentively? Didst thou make 
a good meditation? Didst thou assist at holy Mass with 
reverence and devotion? Didst thou recite well thy usual 
prayers? Didst thou observe moderation at thy meals? 
Didst thou mortify thy appetite in some small thing? Didst 
thou pay attention to the reading at table? How didst 
thou spend the time of recreation? Didst thou try to keep 
up and promote therein spiritual conversation? Didst thou 
make thy spiritual reading well? Didst thou carefully 
make the two examens of conscience? 

After thus examining thyself compare thy present with 
thy past state. If thou perceivest that thou hast made 
some progress, thank God for it, and resolve to be hence 
forth as conscientious and to strive to make still greater 
progress. If, however, the contrary has been the case, 
resolve earnestly to amend and to make up for thy defi 
ciencies. 

Finally, beseech our divine Saviour and His blessed Mother 
to deign to preserve thee in fervor. "The most effective 
means to persevere in good and to make progress in the 
spiritual life," says St. Francis de Sales, " consists in fre 
quently calling to mind what we promised to God in the 
days of our primitive fervor after mature deliberation. If 
he who, from time to time, renews his good resolutions is 
not wholly free from faults, what will become of him who 
never, or only very seldom, renews them?"

bilis es iis quibus peccatum est jucundum." 

M I ready to die? Would I be satisfied at this 
moment to appear before my Judge? 

2. Since my last examination into the state of my soul, 
have I acquired any degree of virtue, conquered any degree 
of vice? Not to advance is to go back. 

3. Do I constantly recall to mind the end of my creation, 
and the particular end of my entrance into religion? Why

a lively faith, profound humility, and utmost purity? What

of my state, and all the mortifications I undergo, with all

prayer, examen, Mass, Office, lecture, meals, recreations, etc., 
with all possible care and attention? Have I the purest in

tion as an essential duty of religion; and do I carefully watch 
over myself and guard against the insinuations of self-love, 
iclf-complacency, and vain-glory? Do I allow myself to

act through caprice or inclination, or do I try to do all as 
directed, with regularity and exactness, referring all with 
fervor to the divine honor and glory, in union with the most 
holy actions and infinite merits of Jesus Christ? Am I 
faithful in making my morning offering, and in renewing it 
during the day? Do I often recall to mind the means ap 
pointed for acquiring this purity of intention ist, to keep 
myself in the presence of God; 2d, to perform each work

ON OBSERVANCE OF RULE. 

AVE I a great esteem and love for our holy Rules 
and am I sincerely disposed to be faithful to them? 
Do I neglect the minor observances; or have I the same love 
for all? Do I fail in them through human respect? Do 
I practise those that are painful in a spirit of mortification, 
or do I try to dispense myself from them, when I can do 
it without being observed? Am I exact in all the exercises 
of the Community, and do I, at the first sound of the bell, 
leave what I have in hand to answer its call? Have I some 
attachment to particular devotions, rather than for general 
observances ? Have I the necessary zeal for the maintenance 
of regularity, and do I give bad example by my frequent 
violations of Rule? Am I faithful in following the customs 
of the Community, although not marked down in the Rules; 
and have I been disposed to seek some relaxation therein, 
by unnecessary innovation or dispensations? 

ON CHARITY. 

IS charity my favorite virtue as it was that of my divine 
Master? Do I study to maintain it among the Sisters? 
Do I study in conversation, manners, and conduct to avoid 



884 Bona Moss Devotions. 

whatever might in the least disturb charity? Am I solicit 
ous to repair the smallest offence by asking pardon; and 
when others ask pardon of me, do I grant it immediately, 
without contention or reserve? Am I always willing to 
assist and help my Sisters, and do I bear with patience their 
defects, weaknesses, and imperfections ? Do I ever dispute ? 
Do I ever speak of the faults of the Sisters ? Do I carefully 
avoid all suspicious and rash judgment all jealousy and

(*}&amp;lt;-*- "Learn of Me," says Jesus, "because I am meek 
and humble of Heart." 

Have I kept silence in regard to those matters which might 
gain me applause? Have I suppressed what might gain 
esteem for others, especially respecting the practice of virtue? 
Have I received humiliation with submission and meekness, 
with the conviction that I merited to be humbled, forgotten, 
and despised? Have I submitted to others in the spirit of 
humility, or have I depended too much on my own prudence ? 
Have I obstinately tried to carry out my own views? Have 
I acted with the view of attracting the esteem and applause 
of others? Have I better fulfilled my duty, or affected to 
appear more pious, when seen, than when not observed by 
any one? Was I not more eager for those things which 
might gain applause, than what would pass unobserved? 
Have I, when praised, experienced satisfaction in it? Have 
I spoken to my own advantage, or, when others praised 
me, did I artfully continue the conversation? Did I think 
myself better than others, and did I dwell with complaisance 



Bona Mors Devotions. 885 

on myself, my talents, my natural qualities, or my supposed 
spiritual excellencies? In preferring myself to others, did I 
condemn or despise them in my heart ? Have I spoken 
too much of myself, or, in depreciating myself, have I 
intended to draw on myself the praise of others, or to pass 
for one that is humble? Have I too much dreaded lest 
my faults should be known, or have I concealed or disguised 
them with too much care, lest I should be corrected or put 
in penance? When corrected, did I excuse myself, and 
give frivolous reasons, in place of candidly admitting my 
faults? In place of profiting by a reprehension, have I 
thrown the blame on others? Have I taken correction 
in bad part, shown too much sensibility, murmured, or 
attributed unkind motives to her who made it? Did I, 
on receiving a penance, make resistance, or submij to it 
with bad grace, even by looks or by murmuring? Have I 
answered with too much forwardness the Superior, my 
elders, or those whom I should respect; and have I spoken 
with pride to my equals or juniors? Has self-esteem made 
me look for special attention; have I felt jealous at others 
being preferred to me? 

ON OCCUPATIONS. 

I shown a repugnance for ati employment, and 
sought that which was more in accordance with 
my fancy, or avoided that which was contrary to it? Have 
I tried to acquit myself of my charge and my duties in the 
sight of God, with care, exactness, and fidelity, for the greater 
advantage of the Community, to the satisfaction of my 
Superiors, and for the consolation of the Sisters? Have I 
too easily complained of an employment because it was 
fatiguing, or because it left me no time for my private devo 
tions? And have I preferred these private devotions to 
duties of obligation? Have I acted in harmony with the 
companion I have had in the same office; and have I had 
for her the respect due to her, if my elder; or have I exer 
cised the proper meekness and charity toward her, if my 
junior? Have I not put her virtue to the test by my caprices, 
my impatience, my want of condescension, and have I not 
even left the most difficult share of the employment to her, 
in order to avoid trouble? 



886 Bona Mors Devotions. 



ON THE VOW OF OBEDIENCE. 

O I continually bear in mind that by my vow of obedience 
I have for ever resigned my will to the direction of my 
Superior? Do I obey her as holding her authority from 
God? Do I comply without hesitation with all the direc 
tions of my Superior, whether in matters of great or little 
moment, agreeable or disagreeable? Do I ever murmur? 
Do I absent myself from the common exercises without leave ? 
Do I obey the call of the bell as the voice of God and go 
quickly and joyfully to the Community exercises? What 
has been my obedience, interior and exterior, to the Rule, 
the Constitutions, and the customs of the house? Have 
I brought to each action its appropriate spirit? Have I 
observed the holy Rules through love, and have I done 
nothing through constraint? Have I been subject to all 
my Superiors alike for the love of God ? Have I fulfilled, not 
only the orders, but also the desires of my Superiors ? Have 
I obeyed carefully, without forgetting anything? Promptly, 
without delay or putting off? Simply, without discourse 
or argument? Faithfully, embracing the command in its 
full extent, and not in part only? Frankly, and cordially, 
without murmur or excuse? What has been my obedience 
with regard to those over me in office, to my infirmarian, 
and to the doctor in times of illness? Have I sought my 
own satisfaction in my obedience? Am I thoroughly con 
vinced that the essence of the religious state consists in 
obedience, based on the love of God, and has my obedience 
been full and perfect, purely for God alone? Have I made 
strong objections, excuses or urgent and persistent petitions 
to avoid an order or a charge,? Have I commented in a 
frivolous, churlish, or disrespectful manner upon the orders 
of my Superiors or have I ridiculed them? Have I obeyed 
from a supernatural motive, without secondary intentions, 
such as self-interest or personal affection and esteem for 
my Superiors? Did I show myself vexed and dejected 
on receiving orders contrary to my tastes and inclinations? 
Have I interfered with the affairs of others, and by so doing 
disturbed the order of the house? Am I in the habit of 
renouncing my own will and judgment, and of bringing 
them into conformity with those of my Superiors? Do T 



Bona fifors Devotions. 887 

obey as willingly, when I imagine I see imperfections in 
my Superiors? Are my Superiors obliged to treat me with 
care, and use words with nice discrimination in order to 
induce me to be obedient? Do I submit equally in that 
which pleases me, as in that which does not in what is 
tiresome and inconvenient, as in that which delights me? 
Am I indifferent as regards work or rest? Silence or con 
versation? Consolations or privations? Have I done 
anything without permission? Have I asked for leave in 
vague terms, in obscure expressions, as though I were afraid 
of being understood? Have I returned persistently to the 
charge, and thus extorted a permission which my Superiors 
were unwilling to grant me? (In general, a good Religious 
requires few permissions besides those for which the Rule 
authorizes her to ask.) Have I taken general permissions, 
which, as a rule, diminish fervor and nourish self-love? 
Have I in any way exceeded the permissions received as 
regards time, place, or circumstances? Each time that 
I have asked a permission, have I been prepared to receive 
a refusal with calmness and humility? How have I followed 
the counsel of the apostle, to submit myself to all creatures 
for the love of God? 

IN IMITATION OF JESUS CHRIST. 

A VE I imitated the obedience of Jesus in His hidden 
life at Nazareth? Can it be said of me: "During 
the whole of her life she has been subject"? Have I always 
done, not as I knew, but as I was told? Have I imitated 
Jesus in His agony in the garden, by receiving with sub 
mission every kind of interior suffering? Have I sought 
for consolation from all with whom I came in contact? 
Have I imitated Our Lord on Calvary? Have I delivered 
myself up generously to be contradicted, humbled, and 
crucified? Am I ready to give my very life for obedience, 
after the example of Pere Lefevre, who said, "It is not neces 
sary to live, but it is necessary to obey"? 

ON THE VOW OF CHASTITY. 

I esteem nothing more precious than this heavenly 
gift; and do I place that strict guard upon my senses 
prescribed by my Rule, lest the enemy should penetrate 



888 Bona Jl/ors Devotions. 

through these avenues and tarnish the purity of my soul? 
Have I always considered my body as the temple of the 
Holy Spirit? Do I hold it in honor? Am I careful to 
observe due modesty while dressing and undressing? Do 
I allow myself too much freedom when alone? Do I give 
toe. much liberty to my eyes? Have I cast curious or cul 
pable glances on dangerous objects, or on such objects 
which, although indifferent in themselves, have nevertheless 
made a bad impression upon me on former occasions? 
When in the parlor, have I observed religious gravity, 
modesty, and humility? When God has permitted that I 
should be exercised with regard to this virtue, have I been 
humble, distrustful of myself, and with the fullest con 
fidence in God, have I sought for help at once from Him? 
"Watch and pray, that you fall not into temptation/ Have 
I been careful in fighting all too natural affections? Have 
I cultivated particular friendships? Have I given way 
to laziness, or sought my ease and comfort too much in 
my manner of lying and sitting and leaning against sup 
ports ? How have I observed exterior order and cleanliness ? 
Am I temperate and polite at table? Have I given too 
much care to my exterior? Do I pray every day for the 
virtue of purity ? Do I live and breathe only for my celestial 
Spouse? Have I immolated the remembrances of the 
world, the legitimate love of my family, of my friends, etc. ? 
Have I been unable to do without the tender affection of 
my Superior or mistress? Have I not sought to be pre 
ferred before my companions? Have I not been troubled 
and preoccupied when I imagined myself to be less loved? 
Have I had frequent recourse to my Superiors, not in order 
to receive good and useful counsel from them, but to find 
satisfaction in an affection with regard to which I was all 
the more reassured, because the object seemed to me the 
more holy? Am I too much inclined to sentimentality in 
my spiritual exercises? And to the practice of favorite 
devotions? Has my love for God been so disinterested 
and energetic that it has known the secret of self-immolation 
for His glory, the salvation of souls, and my own perfection ? 
Have I easily condoned that tenderness in myself, which seeks 
only the consolations of God, and will not put up with 
the slightest interior aridity or suffering? Have I brought 



Bona Mors Devotions. 889 

myself to act with the same vigor, the same devotedness, 
the same evenness of mind, in days of darkness and 
hours of agony, as in days of serenity and consolation? 
Have I known how to appreciate the happiness of total 
self-abnegation, in which sentiment and enjoyment have 
no part: and which requires, on the part of the soul, an 
entire donation; and on the part of God, a perfect liberty 
and freedom of acting in her, unhindered by self-love? Am 
I ready to make any sacrifice in order to render my heart 
more worthy of that of a spouse of Jesus, tearing from it 
without pity every thing which is in any way contrary to 
His perfect dominion? 

Yes, O my God, I love Thee and Thee alone; I love 
Thee purely for Thyself, and not for Thy gifts. 

One only heart, one only love, for one God alone." 

ON THE VOW OF POVERTY. 

IN what esteem do I hold poverty? How do I observe 
my vow of poverty? Do I look upon poverty as one 
of the most important means of perfection, as the mother 
and guardian of virtues? Do I revolve in my mind how 
tenderly Jesus Christ cherished holy poverty, and am I 
endeavoring to keep myself perfectly disengaged from the 
things of this world? Am I contented with the food and 
raiment allowed me? Do I possess anything superfluous? 
Do I look upon anything as my own? Is there anything 
allowed to my use which I would find it difficult or painful 
to resign? Do I consider myself happy in being called to 
a state of utter poverty? Am I truly pleased to feel its 
effects in lodging, food, clothing, sickness? Do I trust 
implicitly in God, and have I no fear of poverty? Am I 
happy when that which is old and worn is given to me for 
my use? What are my dispositions with regard to a change 
of house, of office, of cell, etc. ? Am I without any preference 
for anything which may fall to me? Do I waste my time, 
which is so precious? Have I received .or given something 
without permission? Have I allowed anything to be wasted 
or spoiled? Do I take care of the things given me for my 
use, remembering that they are the property of the Church, 
and of Jesus Christ Himself? When in office have I given 



890 Bona Mors Devotions, 

better things to some than to others, without the consent, 
or contrary to the will of the Superior? Do I try to be really 
poor in spirit? Is my heart free from all attachment to 
the things which are given to me for my use? Should I 
feel annoyed if the Superiors were to take from me a book, 
an employment, a room, a habit, etc. ? Have I nothing 
superfluous, no comforts which are not conformable to 
the religious state? Do I strive to obtain for myself what 
is most beautiful, most easy, most comfortable? Am I 
vexed and impatient when I feel the effects of holy poverty, 
forgetting what St. Philip Neri said: "Whoever attaches 
himself to the things of this world, can not sanctify him 
self " ? Do I ask for exemptions without necessity from the 
general manner of living? In my illnesses, do I make 
exactions for having doctors, medicines, and services, accord 
ing to my fancy? What is my interior poverty? Is my 
heart empty of all? What profit do I derive from spiritual 
poverty? How do I follow in the footsteps of Our Lord, 
by the practice of holy poverty? Oh! if we would be per 
fect, let us make the sacrifice of all which remains in our 
possession, of all that we are and have, and we shall have 
"treasure in heaven" (Matt. xix. 20, 21). 

ON CONSTANCY IN VIRTUE AND PERSEVERANCE. 

AVE I been changeable in my conduct, to-day under- 
taking many things, and to-morrow abandoning 
everything in discouragement? Have I been guided by 
caprice in the practice of virtue, rather than by the Spirit 
of God and the direction of confessors and Superiors? Have 
I contented myself with an inferior degree of virtue, without 
aspiring to constant advancement in perfection? Have I 
not aimed at my perfection with a painful and scrupulous 
anxiety, which troubled and discouraged me, instead of 
laboring at it with fidelity, patience, and confidence in God? 
Do I often recall to mind my promise of perseverance, 
and, not merely looking on it as a vow to wear the habit 
until death, do I endeavor to advance perseveringly and 
steadily in the perfection of my state? It will avail me 
nothing to die a Religious if I have not lived as a true 
Religious; and I may tremble with St. Paul, lest, whilst I 



Bona Mors Devotions. 891 

instruct others unto justice, I myself may become an out 
cast. True, they that instruct others unto justice shall 
shine like stars for all eternity; but I must not forget that 
my own soul is my first interest, my best treasure, my chief 
care, and in vain will be all my efforts for others, if I do 
not cultivate in it the kingdom of God. In vain shall I 
have persevered in wearing the habit, if it be not exchanged 
for a robe of glory hereafter; in vain shall I have vowed to 
serve Him until death, if I serve Him not in spirit and in 
truth. "He that persevereth to the end, shall be saved." 
"No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, 
is fit for the kingdom of God." (Luke ix. 62.) 

Reflections. 

*HAT is death? A complete separation of the soul 
from the body they must part after long years 
of close union. 

2 What will become of my body after death ? Remember, 
man, that thou art dust, and unto dust thou shalt return." 

3. What will become of my soul at death? Oh! what 
will become of my soul? I know not; all is shrouded in 
impenetrable mystery I have expired, the voice of prayer 
has sunk into silence whilst it was yet whispering over 
my body my soul had been judged. Oh! what has become 
of it ? No one knows but God and my own soul. 

4. I shall be judged where? In that room, before the 
Sisters think I have breathed rny last. A fear shall come 
upon them, for beside them is the tribunal, the Judge, the 
accusers, the accused ; in an instant the fate of one they have 
known is sealed for eternity: she is gone, they know not 
whither. 

5. I shall be judged by whom? The living and eternal 
God the great, the just, the equitable Judge! a Judge of 
justice, no longer merciful ; to Him I must render an account 
of thoughts long forgotten, of words lightly spoken, but 
faithfully registered by the accusing spirit words perhaps 
sinful and unatoned for works imperfect, and shrinking 
from the all-seeing, all-enlightening light of the Eternal 
eye -omissions of duty graces neglected inspirations de 
spised. Oh! what an awful judgment, what an awful 
moment even for the good, for who shall be found pure 
in the light of purity itself? What a judgment what a 
moment for the imperfect Religious? Her soul suddenly 



892 Bona Mors Devotions. 

enlightened by the brilliant rays of eternity, embraces in a 
single glance the whole extent of her obligations, the entire 
series of graces which she has received, all the circum 
stances attendant on her infidelities. 

6. Religious have been lost shall I be lost ? Shall I hear 
from the lips of my Judge : Go, ye accursed, into everlasting 
fire; that is to say, all our bonds of union are now dissolved! 
go far from Me, strayed sheep, I am no longer thy Shep 
herd: go far from Me, faithless spouse, I am no longer thine: 
go far from Me, unnatural child, I am no longer thy Father; 
go, for all eternity! Alas, my God! shall this be my sen 
tence the sentence of her whom Thou hast chosen from 
amongst thousands, and called to be Thy spouse, and to 
stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion, and to be of the 
one hundred and forty-four thousand having His name 
and the name of His Father written on their foreheads? 

7. I can be a saint. How? "Abide in Me," saith Our 
Lord; "I am the vine, you the branches: he that abideth 
in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit : for with 
out Me you can do nothing." Confiding, then, in Thee, O 
my God, if I use the plenteous means afforded for sancti- 
fication, I can be a saint a saint for all eternity, for ever 
with the saints, where God Himself shall be my God, and 
shall wipe away the tears from mine eyes, and death shall 
be no more, nor mourning; nor crying, nor sorrow, for the 
former things have passed away. Eye hath not seen, nor 
ear heard, nor hath it entered the heart of man, what 
things God hath prepared for them that love Him. Then, 
O my soul, serve Him here, and He and His angels shall 
minister unto you hereafter; live for Him in time, that you 
may live and reign with Him for all eternity. 

Fidelity the Means of Perseverance. 

HIDELITY in the daily routine of life, as well as on 
great occasions, is the secret of attaining to sanctity 
Our sanctification through Jesus Christ is an edifice formed 
of grains of sand and drops of water a glance mortified 
a word, an ill-timed smile suppressed ; a sentence inter 
rupted ; a recollection stifled ; a cherished letter read rapidly, 
and not read again; a little impulse of nature courageously 
checked; an importunity, an annoyance gently endured; 
sarcasm, a feeling of peevishness immediately suppressed; 
a useless expense curtailed; a shade of sadness quietly 
dispelled; a too natural joy moderated, by a thought of 
the God Who dwells in our heart; a repugnance sur 
mounted; in a word, nothings, trifles imperceptible to human 



Bona Mors Devotions. 893 

eyes, but admirably visible to the penetrating eye of Jesus. 
Behold what we must attend to! These are the very little 
and very great fidelities which bring down into the soul 
torrents of graces, supernatural lights, sweetness, a lasting 
and profound peace, a heavenly serenity of soul, and what 
we may term the familiar caresses of our divine Lord. 

Lord Jesus! give me this fidelity which alone can unite 
me most intimately with Thee, and make me holy even as 
Thou art holy. Amen

Eternity Draws Near/ 

YOU must die; be always prepared. 
You may die when you least think of it. 
You will die, and the moment of death will decide your lot 

for Eternity. 

Consider, meditate, ponder well that terrible word Eternity. 
O Eternity, which alone deserves our care and solicitude! 
O Eternity, which alone is neglected and forgotten by the 

generality of mankind! 
Who will give to mine eyes a fountain of tears that I may 

weep over this forgetfulness of Eternity? 
O Eternity, who shall measure thy depth; who shall sound 

thy boundless abyss? 
Millions and millions of ages are nothing, when compared 

with Eternity! 
After millions and millions of years there will still remain a 

never-ending Eternity. 
Everything else passes away; but Eternity never passes 

away. 
Happy the just, who shall reign with God during a whole 

Eternity. 
Woe to unhappy sinners! if they die in mortal sin they shall 

suffer for all Eternity. 
Yes, my soul, after this short life thou must live for ever 

either in a state of endless happiness or of endless misery. 
Thou art now suspended between these two Eternities; one 

or the other must be thy final lot. 

Canst thou hesitate to choose between an Eternity of happi 
ness or an Eternity of misery? 
What then wilt thou do? 

Think of death, which is the gate to Eternity. 
Think of judgment, which is to decide thy lot for Eternity. 
Think of hell, which is the abode of a miserable Eternity. 



94 Bona Mors Devotions. 

Think of heaven, which is the habitation of a happy Eternity. 
Continually labor to secure the all-important concern of 

Eternity. 
Repent, watch, pray, suffer patiently all the evils of this lift, 

and strive courageously for a happy Eternity. 

Lord, spare me not in time, provided Thou spare me for 

Eternity. 

Prayer. 

/T\Y God, I have cited myself before the tribunal of my 
N"^ own conscience and what do I read there ? O woe 
to me, miserable wretch that I am, my sins are multiplied 
beyond number! Oh, who will have pity on me, and hide 
me from the wrath of my offended God! Shall I dare to 
hope for pardon, or shall I fly from Thee into the dark abyss 
of despair? No, Lord; for hast Thou not said: "In what day 
soever the sinner shall call upon Me, I will hear him: and 
though his sins were as red as scarlet, I will make them whiter 
than snow." Oh! in the clefts of the rock I will hide myself 
in the wounds of my Jesus I will bury myself; for who hath 
ever hoped in Him, and was then confounded ? Hear me 
now, and pardon me for His sake. Art Thou not my Father, 
in very truth a Father of mercy? What then shall I do, 
but cast myself at Thy feet, and humbly crave Thy mercy? 
Behold! I come to Thee blind: Thou canst give me sight- 

1 come to Thee dead: Thou canst give me life. Convert 
me unto Thee renew my spirit enlighten my under 
standing direct and conform my will restore unto me the 
joy of my salvation convert me, and I shall be converted 
and though I have multiplied my evil ways, I shall still 
hope in Thee, that, through the merits of my Lord Jesus 
Christ, Thou wilt have mercy on me. Sprinkle me with 
hyssop (the precious blood of Jesus), and I shall be made 
whiter than snow. O Jesus! be Thou my help and my 
protection, and say to my soul, "I am thy salvation." I 
hope, even in spite of my manifold offences, I hope, by Thy 
merits, for nothing less than to be Thine, all Thine, with 
Thee in paradise for ever. 

O Mary, Blessed Virgin, Mother of God, and my own 
dear Mother, pray to Jesus for me, that I may be faithful, 
that I may find salvation. 

Here make resolutions of serving God during this life, and 
promise to do something for Him in return for His mercies to 
you: propose to conquer at least one difficulty, or to practice, 
on certain occasions, some virtue; place your resolutions in the 
Sacred Heart of Jesus present in the tabernacle: should you

break them, pay a special visit to Jesus on the throne ot 
His love, to ask His pardon, and again renew them. Make a 
short compact with Our Lord, that everything you do during 
this month is to be an act of some virtue, especially such and 
such actions. 

Make compacts also with the ever-blessed Virgin, your guardian 
angel, and patron saint. 

The Rights of a Religious. 

ELIGIOUS having an essential duty incumbent upon 
them of tending toward perfection have, consequently, 
in all the rigor of justice, an unquestionable right to all the 
means that their Constitutions afford them for attaining 
this end. These are the real rights to which they should 
cling and to which they can lay claim. It is the duty of 
Superiors to assure them of their full, constant, and per 
fect enjoyment. Now, here are some of the rights which 
their Constitutions secure them. 

1. A Religious has a right to humiliations. 

2. A Religious has a right to be reprimanded by her Su-, 
periors. 

3. A Religious has a right that her Superior exact her 
entire submission without giving her the motive of her 
command. 

4. A Religious has a right that the Superior dispose of 
her time and of her work. 

5. A Religious has a right that the Superior dispose of 
objects she gave her permission to use. 

6. A Religious has a right to be disposed to accept re 
fusals on the part of the Superior. 

7. A Religious has a right to surfer the effects of poverty. 

8. A Religious has a right to fraternal correction. 

9. A Religious has a right to continual mortification in 
all things. 

10. A Religious has a right to be despised and treated as 
the last of all the Sisters. 

11. A Religious has a right to works the most humbling 
and repugnant to nature. 

12. A Religious has a right to serve her Sisters. 

13. A Religious has a right that others be preferred to 
her. 

14. A Religious has a right to the last place. 

15. A Religious has a right to be looked upon and to be 
treated as a useless servant in the house. 

1 6. A Religious has a right to receive all kinds of public 
penances, even for faults of which she is not guilty. 



896 Bona Mors Devotions. 

17. A Religious has a right to rejoice when treated as a 
fool. 

1 8. A Religious has a right to be the crucified spouse of 
Jesus crucified. 

19. And if, by her conduct, a Religious derives profit 
from her rights, she will have the right to live and to reign 
eternally with 

Jesus Crucified. 
THE RELIGIOUS WHO WILL NEVER BE PERFECT IS: 

HK who excuses herself. 

She who murmurs and finds fault with everything. 
She who complains of the food. 
She who ridicules others. 
She who is indifferent about little things. 
She w r ho evades the vigilance of her Superiors. 
Two things of which one must never complain: clothes or 
food. 

Two prayers which one should frequently repeat: My 
God, let me be neither curious nor talkative. 

Two actions for which one must be always ready: to com 
municate, to die. 

TIS WELL. 
IS well with clear intelligence to see 

That he who says, "I, Lord, will follow Thee, 1 
Says in effect, "I, Lord, will humble be!" 
Then of supremest import tis to know: 
Humility, wherefrom all graces flow, 
Without humiliations ne er can grow. 
As, then, humiliations are the rod 
To perfect those by whom the path is trod 
That leads thro earthly trials up to God, 
Who that is prudent will not welcome scorn, 
And joy to see in shreds his honor torn, 
If Christ may only thus in him be born? 

A PRAYER FOR RETREAT. 

" Domine, ut Videam!" 
*PART into a desert place 

My God, Thou leadest me; 
And here I ask one only grace: 

O Lord, that I may see! 
Nature and earth soft vapors raise, 

That dim rny inward sight, 
Oh, scatter that deceitful haze, 
And let me see aright! 



Mors Devotions. 897 

It may be pain, it may be shame, 

Deep anguish it may be; 
Yet, shall my prayer be still the same, 

O Lord, that I may see! 
Show me Thy law, those precepts wise 

My every step should guide; 
Then let me view with clearest eyes 

My practice side by side. 
Show me my vows, and let me long 

That triple bond survey, 
To see that every link is strong, 

And strengthening day by day. 
Show me my duties, one by one; 

Unshrinking let me see 
What was omitted, and what done 

For other end than Thee. 
Show me myself without disguise, 

As clearly, I entreat, 
As when death s hand shall ope my eyes 

Before Thy judgment-seat ! 
But, dearest Lord, my weakness pleads, 

Let not Thy light stop there; 
The vision of my own misdeeds 

Were else too hard to bear; 
Show me Thyself, Thy tender Heart 

In all its love display, 
One ray of heavenly light impart 

To chase earth s glare away: 
The truths of faith, the joys of love, 

And virtue s solid bliss, 
The glories of the world above, 

The hollouvness of this; 
The sweetness of Thy service, Lord, 

The honor and the joy, 
Oh! how could anything be hard 

In such a proud employ! 
All this, and many a lesson more, 

Make clear and plain to me; 
Oh, I entreat Thee, o er and o er, 

"My God, that I may see!" 

Persevere. 

BERSEVERE in thoroughly conquering yourself in the small 
daily contradictions you receive. Make the bulk of your 
desires about this; know that God wishes nothing from you at 
present save that. Busy not yourself, then, in doing anything 



898 Bona Mors Devotions. 

else; do not sow your desires in another s garden, but cultivate 
well your own. Do not desire not to be what you are, but desire 
to be very well what you are. Be faithful in little things; per 
fect yourself in your present circumstances, and bear the crosses, 
little or great, you will surely meet in the daily routine of your 
duties.

TIME OF SICKNESS. 

*TT* VISITATION of sickness gives an opportunity of prac- 
cJi-^-&amp;gt; ticing patience, humility, and resignation to God s holy 
will. We may acquire much merit by accepting and bearing 
sickness with proper dispositions. We ought to be on our guard 
lest our spiritual enemies lead us to commit such faults as mur 
muring, repining, impatience, petulance, selfishness, unkindness 
and unreasonableness: thus causing us to lose much if not all, 
of the merit which we might otherwise gain. 

During our sickness we should frequently make acts of faith, 
hope, charity, and contrition; also acts of humility, resignation, 
thanksgiving, and union with Our Lord, and pray for the graces 
necessary to bear our sickness for God s glory and our own sanc- 
tification. The prayers of the "Bona Mors," might be used. 

In the "Imitation of Christ" may be found some chapter?, 
especially instructive and useful for the time of sickness. See 
Book I., chap, xxiii., and Book III., chaps, xlvii.-xlix. While

thus disposing ourselves for our end, in case it should be according 
to God s good pleasure to call us away, let us strive to remove 
anxiety from our mind by the thought that we belong by first 
title, and by every title to God, and that He will arrange all 
things, both for us and for all who are dear to us, according to 
His infinite wisdom, love, and goodness. Let us also, in looking 
to the future, excite ourselves to fervent Christian hope. Who 
loves us as God does? He will watch over and take care of 
those whom He loves. "The souls of the just are in the hand 
of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them" (Wisd, 
iii., i). 

PRAYER FOR A HAPPY DEATH.*

and let Thy Mother Mary come to me, and my angel whisper 
peace to me, and Thy glorious saints and my own dear

true Christian patience all the uneasiness, pains, disquiets, 
and troubles under which I labor; preserve me from all temp

I may in no way offend Thee; and grant that this and all 
other earthly trials may be the means of preparing my soul 
for its passage into eternity, that, being purified from all my 
sins, I may believe in Thee, hope in Thee, love Thee above 
all things, and finally, through Thy infinite merits, be ad

ACT OF RESIGNATION. 

^T"~lORD Jesus, Incarnate Son of God, Who for our salva 
t* * tion didst will to be born in a stable, to endure poverty, 
suffering, and sorrow throughout Thy life and finally to die 
the bitter death of the cross, I implore Thee, in the hour of 
my death, to say to Thy divine Father: O Father, forgive 
him [her]! Say to Thy beloved Mother: Behold thy son 
thy child! Say to my soul: This day shalt thou be with Me 
in paradise! O my God, my God! forsake me not at that 
moment! I thirst! O my God! Truly my soul is athirst 
for Thee, the fountain of living water. My life has passed 
away like unto smoke; yet a little, and all is consummated.

it be for life or death. Not my will, but Thine be done: 
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. 

Lord, I submit to all the pains and uneasiness of this 
my illness; my sins have deserved infinitely more. Thou 
art just, O Lord, and Thy judgment is right. 

Lord, I offer up to Thee all that I now suffer, or may 
have yet to suffer, to be united to the sufferings of my Re 
deemer, and sanctified by His Passion. 

I adore Thee, O my God and my all, as my first begin 
ning and last end; and I desire to pay Thee the best 
homage I am able, and to bow down all the powers of my 
soul to Thee. 

Lord, I desire to praise Thee for ever, in sickness as well 
as in health; I desire to join my heart and voice with the 
whole Church of heaven and earth, in blessing Thee for 
ever. 

I give Thee thanks from the bottom of my heart for all 
the mercies and blessings bestowed upon me, and Thy 
whole Church, through Jesus Christ Thy Son; and above 
all, for having loved me from all eternity, and redeemed me 
with His precious blood. Oh, may that blood not have been 
shed for me in vain !

Lord, I believe all those heavenly truths which Thou hast 
revealed, and which Thy holy Catholic Church believes and 
teaches. Thou art the sovereign Truth, Who canst neither 
deceive nor be deceived ; and Thou hast promised the Spirit 
of truth to guide Thy Church into all truth. In this faith 
I resolve, through Thy grace, both to live and die. O 
Lord, strengthen and increase this my faith. 

O my God, all my hopes are in Thee; and through Jesus 
Christ, my Redeemer, and through His Passion and death, 
I hope for mercy, grace, and salvation from Thee. In Thee, 
O Lord, have I put my trust; O let me never be confounded ! 

sweet Jesus, receive me into Thine arms in this day of 
my distress; hide me in Thy wounds, bathe my soul in Thy 
precious blood. 

1 love Thee, O my God, with my whole heart and soul, 
above all things; at least, I desire so to love Thee. Oh, come 
now and take full possession of my whole soul, and teach 
me to love Thee for ever! 

I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. 

Oh, w hen will Thy kingdom come? O Lord, when wilt 
Thou perfectly reign in all hearts? When shall sin be no 
more? 

I desire to embrace every neighbor with perfect charity 
for the love of Thee. I forgive from my heart all who have 
in any way offended or injured me, and ask pardon of all 
whom I have in any way offended. 

Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy ; 
and according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot 
out mine iniquity. 

Oh, who will give water to my head, and a fountain of 
tears to mine eyes, that night and day I may weep for all 
my sins! Oh, that I had never sinned! 

I am filled with confusion when I look back upon my life; 
so little have I done to please Thee, O my God, and so often 
have I offended Thee! 

I place all my confidence in Thy boundless mercy, and 
in the infinite merits of the sufferings and death of my divine 
Redeemer. O Eternal Father, I offer Thee these saving 
merits in full satisfaction for all my sins. 

Lord, be merciful to me a sinner; sweet Jesus, Son of 
the living God, have mercy on me! 

I commend my soul to God my Creator, Who made me 
out of nothing; to Jesus Christ my Saviour, Who redeemed 
me with His precious blood; to the Holy Ghost, Who sanc 
tified me in baptism. Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commend 
my spirit.

I renounce from this moment, and for all eternity, the 
devil and all his works; and I abhor all his suggestions and 
temptations. Oh, suffer not, O Lord, this mortal enemy 
of my soul to have any power over me, either now or at 
my last hour. Let Thy holy angels defend me from all the 
powders of darkness. 

O Heart of Jesus! full of love and compassion, comfort 
and console me. Help me to sanctify my sickness by patience 
und resignation. Lord, remember me in Thy kingdom: 
eceive my soul into Thy embraces.

O DEAREST Lady, sweet Mother mine, watch the hour 
when my departing soul will lose its hold on all earthly 
things, and stand unveiled in the presence of its Creator. 
Show thyself my tender Mother then, and offer to the 
Eternal Father the precious blood of thy Son Jesus for my 
poor soul, that it may, thus purified, be pleasing in His sight. 
Plead for thy poor child at the moment of her departure

cherubim, and seraphim; in the name of the patriarchs and 
prophets, of the holy apostles and evangelists, of the holy 
martyrs and confessors, of the holy monks and hermits, of 
the holy virgins, and of all the saints of God let thy place 
be this day in peace, and thy abode in holy Sion; through 
Christ our Lord. Amen. 

God of clemency! God of goodness! O God, Who, accord 
ing to the multitude of Thy mercies, forgivest the sins of 
such as repent, and graciously remittest the guilt of their 
past offences, mercifully regard this Thy servant, N., and 
grant her a full discharge from all her sins, who most earnestly 
begs it of Thee. Purify, O merciful Father, whatever is 
corrupt in her through human frailty, or by the snares of 
the enemy; make her a true member of the Church, and 
let her partake of the fruit of Thy redemption. Have com 
passion, O Lord, on her sighs, have pity on her tears; and 
admit her to the sacrament of Thy reconciliation, who has 
no hope but in Thee ; through Christ our Lord. Amen. 

I recommend thee, dear sister (or brother) to almighty 
God, and commit thee to His mercy, Whose creature Thou 
art; that, having paid the common debt of nature, thou 
mayest surrender thy soul to thy Maker, Who formed thee 
out of the earth. May, therefore, the noble company of 
angels meet thy soul at its departure. May the court of 
the apostles receive thee. May the triumphant army of 
glorious martyrs conduct thee. May the crowds of joyful 
confessors encompass thee. May the choir of blessed virgins 
go before thee; and may a happy rest be thy portion in the 
company of the patriarchs. May Jesus Christ appear to 
thee with a mild and cheerful countenance, and give thee a

place amongst those who are to dwell in His presence for 
ever. Mayest thou be a stranger to all who are condemned 
to darkness, chastised with flames, or punished with torments. 
May God command thy wicked enemy, with all his evil spirits, 
to depart from thee. May the infernal spirits tremble at 
thy approach, encompassed by angels, and retire into the 
horrid confusion of eternal night. May thy God arise, 
and thy enemies be put to flight. May all who hate Him 
fly before His face. Let them vanish like smoke, or as 
wax before the fire; so let sinners perish in the sight of 
God. But as to the just, let them rejoice and be happy 
in His presence. May all the ministers of hell be filled 
with confusion and shame, and let no evil spirit dare to stop 
thy course to heaven. May Christ Jesus, Who was crucified 
for thee, be thy deliverer; may He deliver thee from death, 
Who for thy sake vouchsafed to die. May Christ Jesus, the 
Son of the living God, place thee in His garden of paradise; 
and may He, the true Shepherd, own thee for one of His 
flock. May He absolve thee from all thy sins, and place 
thee at His right hand in the inheritance of the elect. Oh, 
may it be thy happy lot to behold thy Redeemer face to 
face: to be ever in His presence, in the beatific vision of 
that eternal truth which is the joy of the blessed. And thus 
placed amongst those happy spirits, mayest thou be for 
ever filled with heavenly sweetness. Amen.

world, that as in Thy mercy to her Thou becamest man, so 
now Thou wouldst vouchsafe to admit her into the number of 
the blessed. Remember, O Lord, that she is Thy creature, 
not made by strange gods, but by Thee, the only true and 
living God, for there is no other God but Thee, none that 
can work Thy wonders. Let her soul find comfort in Thy 
sight, and remember not her former sins, nor any of those 
excesses into which she has fallen, through the violence of 
passion and corruption. For although she hath sinned, 
yet she has retained a true faith in Thee, Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost: she has had a zeal for Thy honor, and faith 
fully adored Thee her God, and the Creator of all things. 

Remember not, O Lord, the sins of ignorance of her youth, 
tout, according to Thy great mercy, be mindful of her in Thy 
eternal glory. Let the heavens be opened to her, and the

the chief of the heavenly host, conduct her. May blesse/1 
Peter, the apostle, to whom were given the keys of the 
kingdom of heaven, receive her. May holy Paul, the apostle 
and chosen vessel of election, assist her. May St. John, the 
beloved disciple, to whom was revealed the secrets of heaven, 
intercede for her. May all the chosen servants and martyrs 
of God, who in this world have suffered torments for the 
sake of Christ, intercede for her, that, being delivered from 
this body of corruption, she may be admitted into the king 
dom of heaven, through the assistance and merits of Our 
Lord Jesus Christ, Who liveth and reigneth with the Father 
and the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

Acts may be made. 

An Act of Thanksgiving. 

MY God! Thou hast created, redeemed, and sanctified 
me. Thou hast preserved me in many dangers both 
of body and soul. Thou hast fed me with Thy most blessed 
body and blood. Thou hast shown immense patience in 
bearing with my repeated crimes, and often called me to 
repentance. For these and all other blessings bestowed on 
me, a most ungrateful sinner, I offer Thee innumerable 
thanks. 

An Act 0} Resignation. 

OMY God! I cheerfully receive the certain summons of 
my death. It is a greater happiness to fulfil Thy will 
than to enjoy ten thousand lives. O happy news of my 
departure! I shall soon hear the choirs of angels sing Thy 
eternal praises. Let death hasten his pace, that dying I 
may no more offend Thee, but live with Thee, and love Thee 
eternally. 

An Act of Contrition. 

"T 1 AM truly and heartily sorry for all my sins, not for the 
4-, fear of hell, nor for the hope of reward; but for the 
love of Thee, my God, my only good ! And were I beginning 
instead of ending my life, I would not offend Thee for a 
thousand worlds. . . . O my God ! despise not a contrite and 
humble heart. Amen.

Quia apud te propitiatio

Sustinuit anima mea in

Let Thy ears be attentive:

If Thou wilt observe ini

Because with Thee is pro

My soul has relied on His 
word : my soul has hoped in 
the Lord. 

From the morning watch 
even until night : let Israel

Because with the Lord 
there is mercy : and with Him

And He will redeem Israel 
from all his iniquities.

PSALM L. 



/T|ISERERE mei, Deus, 
?**** secundum magnum 
misericordium tuam. 

Et secundum multitudi- 
nem miserationum tuarum, 
dele iniquitatem meam. 

Amplius lava me ab iniqui- 
tate mea, et a peccato meo 
munda me. 

Quoniam iniquitatem me 
am ego cognosce, et pecca- 
tum meum contra me est 
semper. 

Tibi soli peccavi, et malum 
co ram te feci; ut justificeris 
in sermonibus tuis, et vincas 
cum judicaris. 



Ecce enim in iniquitatibus 
conceptus sum, et in peccatis 
concepit me mater mea. 

Ecce enim veritatem dilex- 
isti ; incerta et occulta sapien- 
tiae tuae manifestasti mihi. 



Asperges me hyssopo, et 
mundabor; lavabis me, et 
super nivem dealbabor. 



Auditui meo dabis gaudium 
et laetitiam, et exultabunt 
ossa humiliata. 

Averte faciem tuam a pec 
catis meis, et omnes iniqui- 
tates meas dele. 

Cor mundum crea in me, 
Deus, et spiritum rectum in- 
nova in visceribus meis. 

Ne projicias me a facie tua, 
et spiritum sanctum tuum ne 
auferas a me. 



VE mercy on me, O 
God, according to 
Thy great mercy. 

And according to the mul 
titude of Thy tender mercies 
blot out my iniquities. 

Wash me yet more from 
my iniquity, and cleanse me 
from my sin. 

Because I know my ini 
quity : and my sin is always 
against me. 

To Thee only have I 
sinned, and have done evil 
before Thee, that Thou may- 
est be justified in Thy words, 
and overcome when Thou art 
judged. 

For behold I was con 
ceived in iniquities: and in 
sins my mother conceived me. 

For behold Thou hast loved 
truth: the uncertain and 
hidden things of Thy wis 
dom Thou hast manifested 
to me. 

Thou wilt sprinkle me with 
hyssop, and I shall be 
cleansed. Thou shalt wash 
me, and I shall be made 
whiter than snow. 

To my hearing Thou wilt 
give joy and gladness: and 
the humbled bones shall 
rejoice. 

Turn away Thy face from 
my sins: and blot out all my 
iniquities. 

Create a clean heart in me, 
O God: and renew a righr 
spirit within my bowels. 

Cast me not away from Thy 
face : and take not away Thy

Deliver me from blood, O 
God, the God of my salva

extol Thy justice. 

Lord, Thou wilt open my 
lips: and my mouth shall 
declare Thy praise. 

Because if Thou wouldst 
have sacrifice, I had verily 
given it: with holocausts 
Thou wilt not be delighted. 

An afflicted spirit is a sac

and humble heart, O God, 
Thou wilt not despise. 

Deal favorably, O Lord, in 
Thy good will with Sion : that 
the walls of Jerusalem may 
be built up. 

Then Thou wilt accept a 
sacrifice of justice, obla

shall they lay calves on Thy

Glory be to Thee, O Lord, and he reads the Gospel; which 
being ended, the Minister says, Praise be to Thee, O Christ. 

Then he kisses the Altar, and, turning to the people, says: 

V. Dominus vobiscum. V . The Lord be with you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

Then he says Oremus, and reads the Offertory. 



OLORD Jesus Christ, 
King of glory, de 
liver the souls of all the 
faithful departed from the 
pains of hell and from the 
deep pit: deliver them from 
the mouth of the lion, that 
hell may not swallow them 
up, and they may not fall 
into darkness, but may the 
holy standard-bearer Michael 
introduce them to the holy 
light; which Thou didst 
promise of old- to Abraham 
and to his seed. We offer 
to Thee, O Lord, sacrifices 
and prayers: do Thou re 
ceive them in behalf of those 
souls whom we commem 
orate this day. Grant them, 
O Lord, to pass from death 
to life; which Thou didst 
promise of old to Abraham 
and to his seed. 

This being finished, the Priest takes tlie paten with the Host \if 
it is High Mass, the Deacon hands the Priest the paten with 
the Host], and offering it up, says:

Then, making the sign of the Cross with the paten, he places the 

Host upon the corporal. The Priest pours wine and water into 

the chalice, saying: 



|EUS, qui humanse sub-

wonderfully dignify it; and 
hast still more wonderfully

Then he makes the sign of the Cross with the chalice, places it

The Priest, looking toward heaven, and stretching out his hands, 
which lie afterwards joins, makes tfte sign of the Cross over the 
Host and chalice, while he says:

While he gives (he censer to the Deacon, he says secretly these word?, 
and is afterwards incensed by the Deacon:

us the fire of His love, 
and the flame of everlasting 
charity. Amen. 



CCENDAT in nobis 
Dominus ignem sui

Tlic Priest, with his hands joined, goes to the Epistle side of the 
Altar, -where he washes his fingers as he recites the following 
verses of Ps. xxv. 

"T* WILL wash my hands 
r-L, among the innocent: 
and will encompass Thy 
altar, O Lord. 

That I may hear the voice 
of praise, and tell of all Thy 
marvelous works. 

I have loved, O Lord, the 
beauty of Thy house, and 
the place where Thy glory 
dwelleth. 

Take not away my soul, O 
God, with the wicked, nor my 
life with men of blood. 

In whose hands are iniqui 
ties : their right hand is filled 
with gifts. 

As for me, I have walked in 
my innocence: redeem me, 
and have mercy upon me. 

My foot hath stood in the 
right path: in the churches I 
will bless Thee, O Lord.

Returning, and bowing before the middle of the Altar, -with joined- 
hands, he says:

Then he kisses the Altar, and turning himself toward the people, 
extending and joining his hands, he raises his voice a little, and 
says:

After pronouncing the words of consecration, the Priest kneeling 
adores the sacred Host; rising, he elevates it; and then placing 
it on the corporal, again adores it. After this he never disjoins 
his thumbs and forefingers, except when he is to take the Host, 
until after the washing of his fingers.

IN like manner, after He

He uncovers the chalice and makes a genuflection; then taking 
the Host in his right hand, and holding the chalice in his left, 
he makes the sign of the cross three times across the chalice, 
saying:

956 Canon of the Mass for the Dead. 

He places the paten under the Host, uncovers the chalice, and 
makes a genuflection; then rising, he lakes the Host, breaks it 
in the middle over the chalice, saying: 

Per eumdem Dominum nos- Through the same Jesus 
trum Jesum Christum Filium Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord, 
tuum. 

He puts the part which is in his right hand upon the paten, breaks 
a particle from the other part in his left hand, saying: 

Qui tecum vivit et regnat in Who with Thee in the 
unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus. unity of the Holy Ghost 

liveth and reigneth God. 

He places the part in his left hand on the paten, and holding the 
particle which he broke off in his right hand, and the chalice in 
his left, he says:

Standing in an inclined position, with his hands joined and rest 
ing on the altar, and his eyes reverently fixed upon the sacred 
Host, he says:

Making a genuflection, the Priest rises and says: 
Panem ccelestem accipiam I will take the bread of

name of the Lord. 



958 Canon of the Mass for the Dead. 

Then slightly inclining, he takes both parts oj the Host between 
the thumb and forejinger oj his left hand, and the paten be 
tween the same /ore finger and the middle one; then striking his 
breast with his right hand, and raising his voice a little, he 
says three times, devoutly and humbly: 

Domine non sum dignus ut Lord, I am not worthy 
Intres sub tectum meum ; sed that Thou shouldst enter 
tantum die verbo, et sanabi- under my roof; say but the 
tur anima mea. word, and my soul shall be 

healed. 

Then with his right hand crossing himself with the Host over 
the paten he says: 

Corpus Domini nostri Jesu May the body of Our Lord 
Christi custodiat animam me- Jesus Christ preserve my 
am in vitam aeternam. Amen, soul to life everlasting. Amen. 

He then reverently receives both parts o) the Host, joins his hands, 
and remains a short time in meditation on the Most Holy Sacra 
ment. Then he uncovers ilie chalice, genuflects, collects what 
ever fragments may remain on the corporal, and wipes the paten 
over the chalice, saying while so doing: 

Quid retribuam Domino What shall I render to 
pro omnibus quae retribuit the Lord for all He hath 
mihi? Calicem salutaris acci- rendered unto me? I will

shall be saved from my 

enemies. 

He takes the chalice in his right hand, and making the sign oj 
the Cross with it, he says: 

Sanguis Domini nostri Jesu The blood of Our Lord 
Christi custodiat animam me- Jesus Christ preserve my 
am in vitam aeternam. Amen, soul to everlasting life. Amen. 

Then he receives tJte dial-ice. 
(After which he communicates all who are to communicate.) 

Those who are to communicate go up to llw sanctuary at the Domine 
non sum dignus, when the bell rings: he Acolyte spreads a 
cloth before them, and says the Connteor. 



Canon of the Mass for the Dead. 959 

Then the priest turns to the communicants, and pronounces a 
general absolution in these words: 

Misereatur vestri omnipo- May almighty God have

R. Amen. R. Amen. 

Elevating a particle of the Blessed Sacrament, and turning toward 

the people, he says: 

Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui Behold the Lamb of God, 
toliit peccata mundi. behold Him Who taketh 

away the sins of the world 

And then repeats three times, Domine non sum dignus. 

Descending the steps of the Altar to the communicants, he admin 
isters the Holy Communion, saying to each: 
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu May the body of Our Lord 
Christi custodiat animam Jesus Christ preserve 
tuam in vitam seternam. soul to life everlasting. Amen. 
Amen. 

Then the Priest holds the chalice for a little wine for the first ablu 
tion, and says: 

Quod ore sumpsimus Do- Grant, Lord, that what we 
mine pura mente capiamus; have taken with our mouth 
et de rnunere temporal! fiat we may receive with a pure 
nobis remedium sempiter- mind; and of a temporal

eternal remedy. 

Then, having taken the first ablution, he says:

Then the Acolyte pouring wine and water over his fingers, he 
washes them, wipes them, and takes the second ablution: he 
then wipes his month and the chalice, which he covers; and 
reads the Communion. 

COM. Lux aeterna luceat eis May light eternal shine

Then he turns to the people, and says: 

V. Dominus vobiscum. V. The Lord be with you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

Then he reads the Post Communion. 

P. C. Praesta, quaesumus Grant, we beseech Thee,

Afterwards he turns toward the people, and says: 
V. Dominus vobiscum. V. The Lord be with you. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo. R. And with thy spirit. 

Turning toward the Altar, he says: 

V, Requiescant in pace. V. May they rest in peace. 

R. Amen. R. Amen. 

Bowing down before the Altar, with his hands joined and resting 
on it, the Priest says: 

Placeat tibi, sancta Trini- O holy Trinity, let the per- 

tas, obsequium servitutis formance of my homage be 

meae ; et praesta, ut sacrificium pleasing to Thee ; and grant 

quod oculis tuae Majestatis that the sacrifice which I,

V. The Lord be with you. 
R. And with thy spirit. 



Per Christum Dominum nos

V. Dominus vobiscum.

He then makes the sign o) the Cross, first upon the A liar, and then

when this mortal hath put

come to pass the saying that 
is written, Death is swallowed

where is thy victory? O 
death, where is thy sting? 
Now the sting of death is sin : 
and the strength of sin is the 
law. But thanks be to God, 
Who hath given us the 
victory through Our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

The continuation of the 
holy Gospel, according to 
St. John. 

At that time Jesus said to 
the multitudes of the Jewc, 
Amen, amen, I say unto 
you, that the hour cometh, 
and now is, when the dead 
shall hear the voice of the 
Son of God; and they that 
hear shall live. For as Thy 
Father hath life in Himself, 
so He hath given to the Son 
also to have life in Himself: 
and He hath given Him 
power to do judgment, be 
cause He is the Son of man. 
AVonder not at this, for the 
hour cometh wherein all that 
are in the grave shall hear 
the voice of the Son of God; 
and they that have done 
good things shall come forth 
unto the resurrection of life, 
but they that have done 
evil, unto the resurrection of 
judgment . 

Mercifully look dow n upon 
this sacrifice which we offer to 
Thee for the souls of Thy ser

We beseech Thee, O Lord, 
that the prayer of Thy sup 
pliants may benefit the souls 
of Thy servants; that Thou 
mayest deliver them from all 
their sins, and make them 
partakers of Thy redemption. 



Anniversary. 

OGOD, the Lord of mer 
cies, grant to the souls 
of Thy servants, whose anni 
versary we commemorate, a 
place of refreshment, the 
happiness of rest, and the 
clearness of Thy light. 



From the Book of Macha- 
bees. In those days, the 
most valiant man Judas, 
making a gathering, sent 
twelve thousand drachms of 
silver to Jerusalem for sac- 
fice to be offered for the sins 
of the dead, thinking well 
and religiously concerning 
the resurrection (for if he 
had not hoped that they 
that were slain should rise 
again, it would have seemed 
superfluous and vain to pray 
for the dead) ; and because 
he considered that they who 
had fallen asleep with godli 
ness had great grace laid up 
for them. It is therefore a 
holy and wholesome thought 
to pray for the dead, that 
they may be loosed from sins. 

The continuation of the 
holy Gospel according to St. 
John.

meam, sed voluntatem ejus,

sed resuscitem illud in novis-

When the anniversary is of one person the prayers are to be said 
in the singular number. 



At that time, Jesus said to 
the multitudes of the Jews, 
All that the Father giveth 
Me shall come to Me; and 
him that oometh to Me I will 
not cast out : because I came 
down from heaven, not to do 
My own will, but the will of 
Him Who sent Me. Now 
this is the will of the Father 
Who sent Me, that of all that 
He hath given Me I should 
lose nothing, but should raise 
it up again in the last day; 
and this is the will of My 
Father that sent Me, that 
every one who seeth the 
Son and believeth in Him, 
may have life everlasting; 
and I will raise him up in the 
last day. 

Be propitious, O Lord, to

Vouchsafe to grant us those merciful crosses and afflictions 
which Thou seest necessary for taking off our affections from 
all things here below. 

Since none can see Thee who love anything which is not

but in sighing after Thee. 

Too bitter, alas! will be the anguish of a soul which is 
separated from Thee, which desires, but cannot come to

We shall see that Thou Thyself art our only good, and

PRAYER TO THE INFANT JESUS. 

aOME to me, O Divine Saviour! vouchsafe to be born in 
my heart; grant that, taught by Thine example, and 
assisted by Thy grace, I may be poor in spirit and humble of 
heart. Keep me chaste and obedient. I wish to live but for 
Thee, and to do all things purely for love of Thee. 

O my Jesus, my supreme and true Good! what can have 
attracted Thee from heaven to be born in a cave, if it be not 
the love that Thou bearest to man? What has drawn Thee 
from the bosom of Thy Father to lay Thyself down in a manger ? 
What has brought Thee down from Thy throne above the stars, 
to stretch Thyself on a little straw? What, from the midst of 
the nine choirs of angels, has placed Thee between two animals ? 
Thou dost inflame the seraphim with holy fire, and lo, Thou 
art trembling with cold in this stable! Thou dost give motion 
to the heavens and the sun, and now Thou canst not move 
without being carried in some one s arms! Thou dost provide 
both man and beast with food, and dost Thou now require a 
little milk to sustain Thy life! Thou art the delight of heaven.

and yet I hear Thee weep and moan ? Tell me who hath re 
duced Thee to such misery? "Who hath done this? Love hath 
done it," says St. Bernard; the love that Thou bearest to man hath 
done it. 

O dearest Infant! tell me what Thou earnest on earth to do? 
Tell me whom Thou art seeking? Ah, I understand Thee now; 
Thou art come in order to die for me, to deliver me from an 
unhappy eternity. Thou art come to seek me, a lost sheep, 
in order that I may no more fly from Thee, but love Thee. Ah, 
my Jesus, my treasure, my life, my love, my all; if I do not 
love Thee, whom, then, shall I love ? Where can I find a father, 
a friend, a spouse more worthy of love than Thou, and who 
has loved me more than Thou hast done ? I am sorry because 
I did not love Thee and serve Thee more fervently. Forgive 
me, O my beloved Redeemer; for I repent of having treated 
Thee with ingratitude. I am sorry for it with all my heart. 
Pardon me, and give me Thy grace, that I may never again 
separate myself from Thee, and that I may love Thee constantly 
during the years that remain to me in this life. My Love, I 
give myself entirely to Thee. Dispose of all that I am. and 
of all that I have according to Thy will. May Thy holy will 
be done in me and through me. O Mary, thou art my advo 
cate; thou dost obtain by thy prayers whatever thou wilt from 
thy Son ; beg of Him to forgive me my offences, and to grant me 
holy perseverance unto death. St. Joseph, do thou also pray for 
me. that I may become daily more pleasing to Jesus.

of the end of your life. This reflection should in 
duce you to place yourself in the state in which you would

like to be found at the hour of your death. We ought, 
said a great saint, to ask of God, through Jesus Christ, the 
grace to repair all the spiritual losses we have sustained 
through our negligence. We should beseech Him, in the 
name and through the merits of this divine Saviour, to 
enable us to attain that degree of perfection to which He 
\vished to conduct us, if we had corresponded with fidelity. 
This practice suits particularly the end of the year. 

In thanksgiving to almighty God, for the spiritual and 
temporal blessings bestowed on you, on your parents, on 
all mankind, during the past year, recite with lively senti 
ments of gratitude the Tc Deurn or Magnificat. 

And in expiation of your infidelities, recite the Miserere. 

AN OFFERING OF THE NEW YEAR. 

OMY God! another year is added to the number of those 
for which I am accountable to Thee. Well may I 
recount them all in the bitterness of my soul, for they have 
been filled with infidelities and ingratitude. Thou hast granted 
them to me to know, to love, and serve Thee, and every one 
of them brings to my recollection numberless omissions of 
these essential duties. Have mercy on me, O Lord, have 
mercy on me, for I have no hope but in Thy mercy. It now 
offers me this new year to repair the evils and retrieve the 
losses of those which are past. Grant, O Lord, that it be 
entirely consecrated to Thy glory, sanctified by Thy love, 
and wholly employed in Thy service. 

A PRAYER TO THE ADORABLE NAME OF JESUS. 

OMOST sweet Jesus, how glorious is that name which 
is given to Thee this day! I rejoice that it is not borne 
by Thee a mere empty name, the shadow of a name, as others 
have borne it; but a name full of truth, and of all perfection. 

I thank Thee, O good Jesus, for the will which Thou hadst 
to save us, accepting the office, with the name, of Saviour; 
fulfil it, O Lord, effectually in me; and seeing Thou art Jesus, 
Esto mihi Jesus. Be to me Jesus, be my Saviour. Amen. 

O blessed Virgin, beseech thy Son to imprint in my heart 
that esteem and love of this holy name, which He imprinted 
in thine. 

May the adorable name of Jesus be the sweet and daily

music of my soul, and the seal of my heart; and, when in 
the agony and cold sweat of death, I shall give the last look 
to heaven for mercy, may the parting sigh of my soul be Jesus, 
sweet Jesus, Amen.

Henceforth I wish to serve Thee faithfully. For the love 
of Thee, O divine Child! I will love my neighbor as myself. 
O Jesus, omnipotent Child, I again implore Thy assistance on 
this occasion (mention it) . Grant that I may possess Thee

OMOST amiable Redeemer! Whose infinite love for 
man far exceeded Thy corporal strength in the crib of 
Bethlehem, receive our fervent adorations and most ardent 
thanksgiving for the first effusion of that adorable blood 
which Thou didst afterwards shed to the last drop for us on 
the cross. Oh, how ardently must Thou have desired our sal 
vation, since Thou didst so soon begin to suffer for us! How 
much must Thou have wished for our confidence, since Thou 
didst so early assume that name which, above all names, is 
best calculated to render Thee amiable in our eyes and 
dear to our hearts. O Jesus! our infant, but most power 
ful Saviour! we now feel that Thou art Our Redeemer, and 
therefore most confidently approach Thy crib, to represent 
to Thee all our wants, and in particular to implore, by Thy 
adorable infancy, by Thy painful circumcision, and above all 
by Thy sacred name, which is the joy of heaven, the terror of 
hell, the consolation of the afflicted, and refuge of sinners, 
that Thou wouldst grant us the intentions of this novena.

and sloth in Thy divine service during the past year, and 
mercifully deign to accept the oblation which we now make 
of every day, hour, and moment of the year we commence. 
Give efficacy by Thy precious blood to the resolutions we 
now make, of living from this moment in the manner we 
should wish to have done when time shall be about to close 
lor ever for us. We fervently offer Thee each and even- 
action of this year, in unison with the adorable actions of 
Thy mortal life: we offer Thee our intentions and every 
movement of body and soul, (most solemnly renouncing 
every motive but Thy love); the most perfect obedience to 
Thy holy will, and ardent zeal for Thy glory. O merciful 
jesus! by the helplessness of infancy, to which Thou didst 
descend for our sakes, strengthen our weakness and fortify 
our resolutions never more to offend Thee. By the silence 
of childhood, which Thou wouldst not break, though Thou 
wert the uncreated Word of God, grant us that spirit of 
silence, recollection, and prayer which will best enable us 
to acquire the other virtues of our holy state. May the 
most ardent love so deeply imprint Thy saving name on our 
hearts that it may be always in our minds, frequently on our 
lips, that it may be our defence in temptation, our refuge in 
danger, and at length our certain passport to a happy eternity.

Thine infinite love. We venerate Thy sacred name in union

Come into our hearts, that Thy Holy Spirit may pray in and

of heaven, the terror of hell, the consolation of the afflicted, 
and the solid ground of our unlimited confidence, mercifully

accompanied thy oblation and in that profound humility, 
which on this solemnity concealed thy glorious privileges 
from all the world. Do thou thyself rive us the Divine Infant 
in each of our communions, as thou didst to holy Simeon. 
Obtain that, like him, a lively faith may discover to us Our 
Lord and Salvation, in the mystery of His humiliation; that 
our hearts may love Him therein ardently, and that frequent 
union with Jesus, in the Sacrament of His infinite goodness, 
may so detach us from the world, that we may never cease

and never cease to love. Amen. 



Bovena to St. Josepb. 

O GLORIOUS descendant of the kings )f Juda! inheritor 
of the virtues of all the patriarchs! just and happy 
St. Joseph! listen to our prayers. Thou art our glorious pro 
tector, and shalt ever be, after Jesus and Mary, the object 
of our most profound veneration and tender confidence. 
Thou art a hidden saint, though one of the greatest of saints, 
and art peculiarly the patron of interior souls. 

In union with all those who have ever been most devoted 
to thee, we now dedicate ourselves to thy service, beseeching 
thee, for the sake of Jesus Christ, Who vouchsafed to love 
and obey thee as a Son, to become a father to us, and to obtain 
for us the filial respect, confidence, and love of children 
toward thee. O powerful advocate of all Christians! whose 
intercession, as St. Teresa assures us, has never been found 
to fail, deign to intercede for us now and to implore for us 
the particular intentions of the novena. (Specify them.) 
Present us, O great saint, to the adorable Trinity with Whom 
thou hadst so glorious and so intimate a correspondence. 
Obtain that we may never efface by sin the sacred image 
according to the likeness of which we were created. Beg 
for us that our divine Redeemer may enkindle in our hearts, 
and in all hearts, the fire of His love, and infuse therein the 
virtues of His adorable infancy His purity, simplicity, 
obedience, and humility. Obtain for us likewise a lively 
devotion to thy Virgin spouse, and protect us so powerfully 
in life and in death that we may have the happiness of dying,

TRovena for tbe Annunciation of ur 

O ADMIRABLE Virgin! the most exalted yet the most 
humble among all creatures! we salute thee, in union 
with the respect and veneration of the angel who was deputed 



A Little Book of Novenas. 1009 

from heaven to hail thee as full of grace, and as the choosen 
Mother of the Author of grace. O most happy Mother! 
most pure Virgin! most favored among all women, why 
can not we join with the generations yet unborn, which 
will call thee blessed? (Luke i.). Why can not we 
share in the profound feelings of humiliation which filled 
th)&amp;lt; soul, even in the moment of thy glorious exaltation? O 
most humble, but most privileged handmaid of the Lord! 
since thou hast found grace before God, obtain for us 
that we may persevere in grace to the end of our lives. 
Since thou hast never felt the anguish which springs from 
sin, and wert never degraded by a single imperfection, thou 
hast no cause to fear those tremendous judgments which 
certainly await us if we continue to lead imperfect, tepid 
lives in the sanctuary of religion. O powerful Protectress 
of those who trust in thee! O Refuge of sinners! whose mis 
fortunes thou well knowest how to compassionate! shield us 
from the anger of thy divine Son; obtain for us that we may 
be like thee ever docile to holy inspirations and ever ready 
to say with thee: "Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum" : 
"Be it done unto me according to thy word;" and since it 
is by thee that Our Lord comes to us, may we, by thee, attain 
to the enjoyment of His adorable presence in heaven. Amen. 
St. Gabriel, angel of the Annunciation, pray thou also for 
us in our present needs. Amen.

that I may be conformed in all things to the will of Thy 
divine Father, however contrary to my own inclinations. 
Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be, etc. 

2. O my Lord Jesus, Who wast so cruelly maltreated in 
the house of Annas and Caiphas; I thank Thee that Thou 
didst vouchsafe to suffer for love of me insults so atrocious, 
and contempt so shameful. Ah! how often have I insulted 
Thee in the person of my neighbor! I humbly ask Thy par 
don, and resolve, with Thy holy aid, to suffer whatever may 
be done against me with patience and gentleness, and never 
to offend Thee again, either in word or work.

3. O Jesus my King! Who wast so scorned by the Jews that 
they preferred to Thee a malefactor, a murderer; I pray Thee 
to grant me pardon for having often preferred to Thee some 
miserable creature, some base gratification. Grant that 
I may rather die than again offend against Thy infinite 
Majesty. Be Thou henceforward the King of my heart; 
and grant that by the help of Thy grace I may ever love and 
serve Thee, until I shall have the happiness to see and enjoy 
Thee in the kingdom of Thy glory. 

Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory be, etc. 

4. O most pure Jesus, most chaste among men! Whose 
innocent flesh was thus torn by the scourging in the house of 
Pilate, to purge away the wicked pleasures which we enjoy 
in ours; I confess that it was for me Thou didst suffer such 
cruel torments. I am confounded when I reflect on the 
blows I have caused Thee, and how often I have wounded 
Thee by my sensual gratifications. I entreat of Thee by all 
Thy sufferings to sanctify my body and my soul, to wash 
me and purify me by Thy precious blood from all my filthy 
stains. Ah! let not that flesh which was once cleansed in 
Thy blood, be again defiled with sin. May I serve Thee to 
the end of my life with a clean heart, and may all my actions 
be guided by the purest intentions.

And since there was no part of Thy sacred body which was

over sinners, that they may be reclaimed; over the heathen, 
that they may be enlightened; over the perfidious Jews, 
that they may be softened; over all, that all being united in 
the same faith, in the same hope, and in the same charity, 
we may reign with Thee and in Thee, in that charity which 
shall subsist for ever.

upon the cross, and didst shed Thy blood lo free me from

love which Thou hast borne me, and the pain which Thou 
hast suffered for me. I kiss with the deepest respect Thy 
feet and Thy hands; I adore Thy Sacred Heart, which was 
opened for love of me; and I resolve, from this time forth, 
rather to lay down my life than to crucify Thee again by any 
mortal sin. For love of Thee, I crucify myself anew on the 
cross of my vows, and resolve to imitate Thy example faith 
fully to the end of my life. O good Lord, my blessed Saviour!

achieve over sin and hell, and by that throne of glory to which 
Thou wast exalted by Thy Eternal Father in heaven: grant 
that I also, in the hour of death, may triumph over all my 
enemies, and come at last with Thee to the joys of paradise.

"Resurrection of our XorD. 

JESUS, Who didst confound all Thine enemies by 
clothing in glory and splendor that body which had 
been the victim of the cruelty of man, give me grace to die to 
myself that I may rise again with Thee, and after Thy like 
ness lead a new, divine, immortal life: new, by change of con

tal by perseverance in well doing. Work in my heart, O 
Lord, this happy change; make me pass from .death to life, 
from darkness to light, from a life full of imperfections to a 
life perfect and worthy of Thee. Make me go on from light 
to light, from virtue to virtue, till I come at last to Thee, O 
God of virtue, source of all life, and of all light. To thee 
also I turn, O holy Virgin, who had the greatest share in 
the sufferings and the glory of thy divine Son ; deign to make 
me a partaker of that divine joy which thou didst feel on the 
blessed day of His Resurrection. Dry my tears and free my 
heart from all oppressive sadness. Let Thy risen Son enter 
into my heart, as through the closed doors, into the upper 
chamber. Let Him say to me, as to the Apostles, "Peace 
be to thee;" let Him show to me, as to Thomas, His sacred 
wounds; let Him abide with me continually, and never more 
depart from me.

O JESUS! triumphant Conqueror ot sin and death! Who 
hast taken possession of that seat of bliss purchased 
by Thy blood, remember Thy tender promise that Thou 
wouldst not leave us orphans. Send down upon us and upon 
Thy whole Church that Spirit of light, of truth, and of love 
Who alone can bring to our minds, and imprint on our hearts, 
the divine lessons of humility, poverty, obedience, and con

mortal life. But, alas! if Thine apostles themselves were 
rendered unworthy of receiving the plenitude of Thy Spirit,

which was so lovely, so amiable, so deserving of their tenderest 
love, how can we hope for His descent into our hearts, which 
are defiled. by a thousand imperfect and sinful inclinations? 
O my God, if Thou desirest to give us Thy divine Spirit, pre 
pare Thyself His dwelling in our souls; unite our hearts and 
affections to the ardent sighs and perfect dispositions with 
which Thy blessed Mother and apostles awaited His coming. 
And Thou, O adorable Spirit! Who breathest where Thou

wilt teach all truth to the end of time. O Spirit of purity! 
Spirit of peace! Whom the foulest stains of sin can not resist, 
purify our souls, and infuse therein that peace which the 
world can not give. Oh, rend the heavens and come down,

Thee, we may faithfully comply with the duties of our holy

O Thou, of Comforters the best, 
O Thou, the soul s delightful guest, 

The pilgrim s sweet relief; 
Thou art true rest in toil and sweat, 
Refreshment in the excess of heat, 

And Solace in our grief. 
Thrice blessed light, shoot home Thy darts, 
And pierce the centers of those hearts 

Whose faith aspires to Thee; 
Without Thy Godhead, nothing can 
Have any price or worth in man, 

Nothing can harmless be. 
Lord, wash our sinful stains away. 
Water from heaven our barren clay, 

Our wounds and bruises heal; 
To Thv sweet voke our stiff necks bow;

Whose only hope is Thy sure Word, 

The seven gifts of the Spirit: 
Grant us in life Thy helping grace, 
Grant us at death to see Thy face, 
And endless joys inherit. Amen. 

Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Thy faithful, and kindle

that use it become the friends of God. Thou wert buried 
in obscurity in this valley of tears, but now thou art elevated, 
O Mother of God, to the highest pinnacle of glory! Should 
not thy triumphant exaltation encourage us to despise this 
world, and aspire after the next? For, O amiable Virgin! How 
short were thy sufferings on earth, yet for all eternity thou 
shalt be admired in the holy assembly; among the elect thou 
shalt have praise, and among the blessed thou shalt be blessed. 
Look down then with compassion on us poor banished 
children of Eve; draw our hearts after thee, by filial con 
fidence and vigorous exertions, to imitate thy virtues: above 
all, obtain for us true humility, which neither seeks nor 
values any earthly distinction; poverty of spirit purity of 
heart that thirst after the strong and living God, which can 
never be satisfied until His glory appears and such ardent 
love of our Divine Spouse, as may cause us to despise the 
whole world, and incessantly sigh after those eternal joys, 
of _which it is written: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, 
neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things 
God hath prepared for them That love Him." (Cor. II, 9.) 

IRovena for tbe Bativitg of tbe JBleesefc Dtrgiu /ifoarg. 

OMARY, the channel of God s tenderest mercies to man! 
thou wert promised from the beginning of the world 
to crush the serpent - head, to bring forth the Redeemer of 
mankind. In thy sacred birth appears the dawn of that 
glorious day of grace for which all nations ardently sighed. 
O blessed infant, already thou beginnest to accomplish 
the predictions of the prophets, and to satisfy the longing 
desires of the just; already thou hast conceived in thy heart, 
by the most perfect love, that adorable Being, Who was 
afterwards to be born of thee! O happy Virgin! who, on 
entering the world, didst become a victim of charity, per 
fectly and unreseivedly submissive to the will of God, may 
I, even at the last hour of my life, be enriched with a share 
of the dispositions with which thy soul was adorned in thy 
earliest infancy. Thou art the dignified descendant of 
kings, patriarchs, and prophets, yet thy birth so little cor 
responds with thy rank, that even the commencement of 
thy life makes thee like to Him, Whom thou wert destined 



A Little Book of Novenas. 1021 

to resemble in all things. Inspire me, then, by thy example 
and intercession, with that spirit of renunciation, detach 
ment from the world, and self-contempt, which I promised 
at my baptism, but which I solemnly engaged to practice 
at my religious profession. Thou knowest the weakness 
and perverse inclinations which I brought into the world, 
and which, unhappily, have gained strength with increasing 
years. I conjure thee, O immaculate Virgin! by the purity 
and sanctity of thy nativity, by the riches of grace and virtue 
which the weakness of childhood then concealed in thee, 
to obtain for me strength to fulfil the duties of my exalted 
state, to co-operate with the graces of heaven, and to advance 
daily and even hourly toward that perfection to which I 
am bound to aspire. 
R. Amen.

IMMACULATE and ever-glorious Mary! Mother of 
mercy! ever gracious, ever bountiful, behold, we thy 
suppliants, prostrate before thee in all humility, most earnestly 
implore thee to be our protectress and advocate with God, 
to obtain for us those graces and blessings which may best 
conduce to His greater glory and our own sanctification. 
More particularly we beseech thine intercession in behalf 
of this Institute, for the exercise of those works of mercy 
and charity, which Jesus Christ, the Almighty Son of God, 
did so love when on earth. 

Defend it, O Blessed Lady, against its enemies. May 
it extend and prosper; and may the worship of God, thine 
honor, and the welfare of His servants, be promoted wherever 
it is established throughout the world. 

May the unity of charity prevail in all our Communities, 
and all scandals be unheard of amongst us. May those 
whom thy Divine Son has made His spouses by calling them 
from their homes and kindred to dispense His mercies to 
their fellow-creatures, possess the true spirit of their divine 
vocation. 

May they in all things seek to be united to Him and to 
thee, to advance in all perfection by the observance of their 
Holy Rule and their vows; to deny themselves and be con 
formable to God s holy will. 



IO22 A Little Book of Xovcnas. 

Obtain for them an ardent and ever- ncreasing zeal for 
the functions of the Institute. May their zeal be blessed 
by God, and efficacious for the welfare of the suffering, the 
erring, and the ignorant. Preserve them from all il usions, 
and sustain them amidst temptations. Beseech Our Lord 
to add to their numbers subjects capable of glorifying Him, 
by efficaciously laboring for their own sanctification in the 
service of the poor; and so enlighten and direct all the 
Superiors of the Institute, that they may neither admit nor 
retain any save those to whom He has granted a due voca 
tion. 

May the blessing of God and thy protection be with all 
whom the Sisters protect and instruct. Comfort and de- 
l nd our parents, relative , and friends, and bring them to 
the enjoyment of eternal life with all our benefactors. 

That thou canst obtain for us these benefits we know, O 
holy Mother of God; and we have filial confidence that thou 
wilt be favorable to us, because thou art the Mother of 
mercy, our Mother, and patroness. Amen.

OPURE and happy spirits, whom the Almighty selected 
to become the angels and guardians of men! I most 
humbly prostrate b. fore you, to thank you for the charity 
and zeal with which you execute this commi.s ion. Alas! 
how many pass a long life, without ever thanking that invisible 
friend to whom they a thousand times owed its preservation! 
O charitable guardians of those souls for whom Christ died! 
O burning spirits, who can not avoid loving those whom 
Jesus eternally loved! permit us to address you on behalf 
of all .hose committed to your care, and to implore for them 
all in general a grateful sense of your many favors, and also 
the grace to profit by your charitable assistance. O angels 
of those happy infants who as yet are without spot before 
God, preserve their innocence we earnestly conjure you. 
Angels of youth who are exposed to so many dangers, con 
duct them safely to the bosom of God, as Tobias was con 
ducted back to his father. Angels of those who employ 
themselves in the instruction of youth, animate them with

ever to keep God in view, as you do, that they may worthily

and successfully cooperate with the invisible guardians of 
those who are in their care. O angels of the clergy, who 
have the eternal Gospel to preach to those who abide on 
earth, present their words, their actions, and their intentions 
to God, and purify them in that fire of love which consumes 
you. Angels of those who are destined to follow the Lamb 
whithersoever He goeth, obtain for them the true spirit of their 
holy state, particularly the spirit of silence, recollection, and 
prayer, that in life and death they may be worthy to be 
united to their heavenly Spouse. O angels of all those 
who, throughout the world, are deprived of religious in 
struction, open for them some source of salvation, raise up 
some one to break for them the Bread of the Word; and you, 
O guardian angels of sinners, charitable guides of those un 
happy mortals, whose perseverance in sin would embitter 
even your unutterable joys were you not established in the 
peace of God, O join us, we ardently beseech you, in imploring 
their conversion. Angels of all those who at this moment 
struggle in the agonies of death, strengthen, encourage, and 
defend them against the attacks of their infernal enemy. 
O faithful guides! holy spirits! ardent adorers of the Divinity! 
guardian angels of all creatures! protect us all; teach us to 
love, to pray, to combat on earth, and rather obtain for us 
an instant death, than permit us to commit one mortal sin.

all the fervor of our hearts we desire to testify our love and

the innumerable favors He bestowed on thee during thy

He enriched and adorned thy pure soul even from thine

earliest years: and for those eminent virtues by which thou 
didst glorify Him and become so bright a model to thy people. 
We rejoice with thee, O most beloved and blessed saint, 
for that glory and bliss to which thou art now exalted in 
recompense of thine heroic virtues and many sufferings, 
and which thou wilt for ever enjoy in the bosom of God. Oh, 
then, since thou art so happy, take pity on us thy children, 
who claim thy powerful intercession with lively confidence. 
Remember the many miseries and dangers to which we are 
still exposed; speak to God in our behalf; implore for each 
one of us all the graces we ask, both for ourselves and those 
who are dear to us, and especially the favor we petition for 
in this novena. (Here mention it.) 

Deign also, we conjure thee, O blessed saint, to beseech 
the Holy Spirit to infuse into our soul those virtues which 
will render us most pleasing to God and conformable to our 
divine Spouse humility, meekness, patience, charity, and 
obedience fervent and constant devotion to the mysteries 
of His life, Passion, and death; tender love of His Blessed 
Mother; confidence in her protection and zeal for her honor; 
the spirit of prayer and recollection; sincere esteem and 
affection for our state; fidelity to each observance, together 
with the true spirit of our Holy Rule, and a generous and 
perfect love of God and of His holy will above all things. 

Take also under thy special patronage, O glorious saint, 
the children confided to our care; watch over them unceas 
ingly, and obtain for them a solid piety and a great horror 
of sin. 

Intercede also for our suffering poor and assist us in all 
our undertakings, that we may ever promote the greater 
glory of God here, and that we may bless Him and love Him 
eternally with thee. Amen.

To thee, then, it peculiarly belongs, not only to follow the 
Lamb whithersoever He goeth, but also to lead many virgins 
in thy train. Oh, receive us into the happy number of those 
whom thy glorious example has urged to the heroic practice 
of religious perfection; obtain for us a share in the disposi

already far advanced in eminent holiness, and, forgetting 
thy people and thy father s house, didst enter the Temple, 
to live to God, and for Him alone. We beseech thee, by 
the singular graces bestowed on thee then, to employ thy 
powerful interest in our behalf, and to obtain for us the inten

Remember, O most holy Virgin! that thine early flight 
from the world, thy spirit of sacrifice and heroic perfection, 
even in childhood, were graces which entitle thee not only to 
our veneration, but to our tender confidence. Listen, then, 
to the petitions we now make, and obtain for us the true 
spirit of the interior life, that the Heart of Jesus may be our 
sanctuary, where we abide secure from all dangers. Teach us 
to commemorate thy consecration of thyself to God on the 
day of thy Presentation by a fervent renewal of our vows; 
that, after thine example, we may leave all in heart and will, 
and find all in Christ, and thus love God above all things 
most ardently, and all creatures, for His sake; that His ador 
able will may be ours, and that every exertion of our mind 
and body may be happily consecrated to the promotion of 
His greater glory. Amen.

God, who abhors iniquity. Obtain for us, then, that angelic 
purity which was thine earliest and favorite virtue, that 
purity of heart which will attach us to God alone, and that 
purity of intention which will consecrate every thought, 
word, and action to His greater glory. Obtain also for us a 
constant spirit of prayer, silence, and self-denial, that we 
may recover by penance that innocence which we have lost 
by sin, and at length attain safely to that blessed abode of

Q, Ah! we shrink from pain and sorrow, 
We are frightened when we hear; 
We must live in constant struggles, 
We must die to all that s dear.

At the end all pain shall cease; 
If the battle be a fierce one, 
There shall be eternal peace.*

wore till your death: obtain for us all the grace to abhor all 
the pomps and vanities of the seductive world, and to apply 
ourselves continually to the abnegation of our own will and 
the mortification of the flesh.

arch St. Benedict, despised all the artifices of the devil, who 
attempted to drive you from your solitude, and by the com 
plete victory which you obtained over your evil imaginations 
by casting yourself naked amidst thorns and briars: obtain 
for us all the grac to ris? superior to all the assaults of the 
infernal enemy, and to be always ready to endure any evil 
rather than to stain our souls with a single sin. 

Glory be, etc. 

3. By the generosity with which you, O great Patriarch 
St. Benedict, pardoned your subjects, who, after having 
chosen you superior, began to persecute you in the most 
unworthy manner, even attempting to poison you: obtain

contempt with which it shall please God to visit us during 
the few days of this our mortal life. 

Glory be, etc. 

4. By that truly apostolic zeal with which you, O great 
Patriarch St. Benedict, broke the idols in pieces, pulled 
down the temples, burnt the woods which retained the 
inhabitants of Monte Cassino in the darkness of paganism, 
and established the faith of Jesus Christ, through the whole 
neighborhood, by the erection of your monastery; by that 
ardent love of God and your neighbor which led you to lay 
the foundation of that great Order which has given to the 
Church hundreds of saints, and so many distinguished labor-

OHOLY father St. Benedict, blessed by God, both in grace 
and in name, who, whilst standing in prayer with thy 
hands raised up to heaven, didst most happily yield thy angelic 
spirit into the hands of thy Creator, and hast promised zealously 
to defend against all the snares of the enemy, in the last struggle 
of death, those who shall daily commemorate thy glorious depart

day, and every day, by thy paternal blessing, that I may never

from the lips of thy brother, the great Patriarch St. Benedict; 
do thou, whose pure soul, on its departure from its mortal habi 
tation, was seen soaring toward heaven in the likeness of a 
dove, as if to give testimony that thy life had been enriched 
with the fullest gifts of the Holy Spirit, obtain for us from God 
the gift of prayer and of contemplation, and of listening with 
zeal and docility to all instructions; come to our aid in the 
pursuit of all the virtues that should adorn a good Religious,

in the evil day and be in all things perfect," through Jesus Christ 
Our Lord. Amen.

the benefits we confer on him, that we may merit the blessed

mercy. 

Glory be, etc. 

6. By that wonderful constancy with which, by redoubling 
your prayers, your austerities, and your zeal, O great saint, 
you dispersed the powers of hell, which, arrayed against you, 
persecuted you for so long a time with frightful images and

were favored wich ecstasies, visions, and revelations, and 
the most intimate communications with His divine Majesty: 
obtain for us, we pray you, the grace to be equally powerful 
against the assaults of our spiritual enemies, and that we

9. By the extraordinary love which you had for suffering 
for which you were accounted worthy to share in the mosl 
bitter pains of your crucified Spouse; and, through which, 
though reduced to the extremest weakness, you became a 
spectacle of admiration to all around you by the serenirj 
and joy with which you endured the most frightful torments: 
obtain for us, of the Lord, grace to receive with Christian 
resignation and holy joy all the crosses with which God shall 
be pleased to visit us, so that, after bearing the mortification

TRovena to St. jfrancis De Sales.* 

f~\ GREAT prelate, most blessed saint, model of bishops, 
^-^ the glory of the Church! thou wast and ever shalt be 
revered on earth as a man according to God s own heart, 
and a most perfect imitator of our adorable model, Jesus 
Christ. Thou wast the champion of the faith whose zeal 
extirpated heresy; the ardent victim of charity and docile 
disciple of that heavenly spirit Who spoke by thy pen, and 
rendered thy inspired doctrine the treasure of the Church. 
O good and faithful servant! thou hast now entered into the 
joy of thy Lord; the divine and holy object of thy love on 
earth is now thy reward exceedingly great in heaven. O 
amiable saint, whose tender, compassionate charity was 
always the refuge of the miserable, despise not our supplica 
tions. Since thy conduct on earth toward all thy fellow- 
creatures, particularly the weakest, marked thee out, Hke 
thy beloved Master, as the friend of sinners, show thyself 
such to us, thy daughters, by obtaining for us the intentions 
of this novena. Receive us, O great Master of solid perfec 
tion! into the number of those whom thou didst form accord 
ing to the true spirit of the religious state. Teach us 
those heavenly virtues which thy blessed life, no less than 
thy word, so constantly inculcated. Thou wast one of the 
most humble of men, though gifted with all that could exalt 
thee before God and the world: O plant in our hearts that

root of every virtue. Thou wast an angel of peace, wnost 
presence alone gave consolation to the most afflicted hearts, 
and whose heavenly meekness succeeded in gaining the most 
obdurate sinners; obtain then for us, also, that peace of God 
which surpasseth all understanding; a condescending meek 
ness in our conduct toward our neighbor. But principally 
teach us thy own favorite lesson of perfect conformity to the 
will of God, that we may repose tranquilly in the arms of 
His adorable Providence; that we may cast all our solicitude 
on God, so as "to ask for nothing and refuse nothing;" at 
least to ask for nothing more earnestly than the treasure 
of His divine love, and refuse nothing so resolutely as the 
misfortune of consenting to sin. Amen. 

PRAYER TO ST. FRANCIS. 

O GLORIOUS St. Francis, model of the interior life, and 
full of zeal for the salvation of souls! obtain for me the 
grace to employ all my faculties, not for my own sanctification

works, I may attain with thee the blessedness promised to the 
merciful: " Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy; " 
and that I may one day have a share in the glory which thou 
didst enjoy in paradise with the angels and saints, where those 
that edify and instruct to justice shall shine as stars for all 
eternity. (Dan. xii. 3.)

PBAYER TO OBTAIN THE PROTECTION OF ST. FRANCIS 
DE SALES. 

GREAT St. Francis, glorious apostle of Jesus Christ, 
seraph of the earth, who didst breathe but for the glory 
of God; perfect imitator of thy meek and humble Saviour, 
and devoted child of the holy Mother of God! deign to receive 
me among the number of thy special clients; be henceforth 
my advocate, my counselor, my friend, and my father. 
Thy prayers, even on earth, were the instruments of innumer 
able miracles of grace; Oh, vouchsafe to offer one for me, 
now that their efficacy is so greatly increased in heaven. 
May my entire conversion now add another to the already 
countless triumphs of thy charity. Teach me, like thee, 
to see God in my fellow-creatures; and for His sake, to make 
myself all to all, weeping with them that weep, rejoicing 
with them that rejoice. May the example of thy wondrous 
meekness sink into my soul and excite my earnest, persever 
ing efforts to imitate it. Strengthen me, by thy prayers, to 
pursue the difficult practice of interior mortification, without 
which I can not hope to possess my soul in peace and 
patience. Oh! enkindle in my heart one spark of the heavenly 
fire of charity which glowed in thine. Teach me, like thee, 
to seek and find my happiness in God, and to feel that it 
is good to live, lo labor, and rejoice in Him alone. Shield 
me against the many perils which beset my path: watch 
over my immortal interests, and obtain that my soul may 
die the death of the just, and my last end be like unto 
thine. Ameri. 

PRAYER OF THE CHURCH. 

OGOP, Who wast pleased to give blessed Francis. Thy

souls, mercifully grant that being plentifully enriched with 
the sweetness of Thy charity, by following his directions 
and by the help of his merits, we may obtain life everlasting, 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

vxA* myself before thee, O blessed St. Ann. Thou art that 
beloved and privileged creature who, because of thy extraordinary

tTbe IRovena of (Brace in Ibonor ot St. jfrancis f avfer, 
Epostle of tbe flnoies. 

HIS novena in honor of St. Francis Xavier is called the 
Novena o) Grace because so many graces and marvelous 
blessings have been bestowed by God upon numerous souls 
who have made it, in response to the intercession of St. Francis 
Xavier, the great Apostle of the Indies. We learn from a leaflet 
issued by the press of the Apostleship of Prayer, that the origin 
of this novena, which is celebrated in many parishes of the 
Jesuit Fathers, annually from the 4th to the i2th of March, is 
due to the saint himself, who appeared to Father Marcello 
Mastrilli, S.J., at Naples, in December, 1633, when he lay 
mortally wounded in the head by a blow from an iron hammer, 
which had fallen one hundred feet out of the hand of a workman. 
All hope of his recovery had been abandoned. The prayers of 
the Church for those who are at the point of death were being 
said for the suffering priest, who had already received the last 
sacraments, when suddenly St. Francis appeared at his side, 
in the garb of a pilgrim, staff in hand, and radiant with heavenl}

light. "Will you go to heaven or to India?" the saint asked 
having in view a promise recently made by the dying man to 
go to India if his life would be prolonged. The good Father 
replied: I have no will save the will of God " "Very well " 
came the saint s answer; "Renew your vow. Be of good chee r 
You shall be made well." He recovered his health. 

St. Francis Xavier then promised his aid to all who would 
make a novena from the 4th to the i2th of March, and receu- 
tne sacraments. The efficacy of this novena is not restricted 
to the days mentioned. It may be made in preparation for the 
teast of the saint, which is the 3d of December. 

PRAYERS FOR THE NOVENA OF GRACE. 

St. Francis Xavier s Prayer for Unbelievers. 

CfTERNAL God, Creator of all things, remember that 
^-l the souls of unbelievers have been created by Thyself 
and formed to Thine own image and likeness. Behold, O 
Lord, how, to Thy dishonor, hell is being filled with them 
Remember Lord, that Jesus Christ, Thy only Son, shed 
His most precious blood, and suffered a most cruel death 
for their salvation. I beseech Thee, O my God, do not 
permit that Thy beloved Son be any longer despised by 
unbelievers, but rather, being appeased by the prayers and 
supplications of the saints, and of the Church, the most 
blessed spouse of Thy divine Son, vouchsafe to be mindful 
of Thy mercy, and, forgetting their idolatry and infidelity, 
bring them to know Him Whom Thou didst send, Jesus 
Christ, Thy Son, Our Lord, Who is our life and resurrection, 
through Whom we are redeemed and saved, to Whom be 
all glory for ever. Amen. 

PRAYER TO ST. FRANCIS XAVIER. 

/~) MOST lovable and charitable saint, in union with 
thee I adore the divine Majesty. My heart is filled 
with joy at the remembrance of the marvelous favors with 
which God blessed thy life on earth, and of the great glory 
that came to thee after death. In union with thee I praise 
God, and offer Him my humble tribute of thanksgiving. 



A Little Book of Xovenas. IO Si 

I implore thee to obtain for me, through thy powerful inter 
cession, the greatest of all blessings that of living and 
dying in the state of grace. I also beg of thee to secure 
for me the special favor I ask in this novena [mention your 
request]. May the will of God be done. If what I am 
praying for is not for God s glory or for the good of my 
soul, I beseech thee to obtain for me what is most conducive 
to both. 

V. Pray for us, St. Francis Xavier; 

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of 
Christ. 

Let us pray. 

OGOD, Who hast vouchsafed, by the preaching and 
miracles of St. Francis Xavier, to join unto Thy 
Church the nations of the Indies; grant, we beseech Thee, 
that we, who celebrate his glorious merits, may also imitate 
his example, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

ANOTHER PRAYER TO ST. FRANCIS XAVIER. 

O FERVENT apostle, indefatigable laborer in the vine 
yard of the Lord, glorious St. Francis Xavier, who, 
urged by a burning zeal for the salvation of souls, didst expose 
thyself to extreme dangers, and didst welcome the most appalling 
labors and sacrifices, vouchsafe also to take charge of my per 
fection. 

Obtain that I may imitate thy perfect detachment from crea 
tures, thy confidence in God, thy abandonment to the divine 
will, thy humility, obedience, and charity, thy generosity in the 
practice of virtue, and thy zeal for souls. Enkindle in my heart 
the sacred fire with which thy great soul was always inflamed, 
that I may labor earnestly to make Jesus Christ reign in all 
hearts, and that, having had the happiness of walking in thy 
footsteps here below, I may one day enjoy with thee the bliss 
of heaven. Amen.

HRANCIS XAVIER, a young Spanish gentleman, in the 
dangerous days of the Reformation, was making a name 
for himself as a professor of philosophy in the University of 



1052 A Little Book of Novenas. 

Paris. He had seemingly no higher aim, when St. Ignatius 
of Loyola won him to heavenly thoughts. Then, and for ever 
after, Francis gave himself unreservedly to gain souls to God. 
After a brief Apostolate amongst his countrymen in Rome, 
he was sent by St. Ignatius to the Indies, where, for twelve 
years, like another St. Paul, he was to wear himself out bear 
ing the Gospel to Hindustan, to Malacca, and to Japan. Though 
vested with the dignity of Nuncio Apostolic, and Superior over 
his religious brethren, heonly used his authority to take for 
Jumsejf the largest share~of the toi^s and dangejg^of the workT 
Thwarted by the jealousy, covetousness, and Carelessness oi* 
those who should have helped and encouraged him, neither 
their opposition nor the difficulties of every sort which he en 
countered could make him slacken his labors for souls. He 
was ever preaching, baptizing, hearing confessions, discussing 
with the learned, instructing the ignorant; and yet all this was 
done with the greatest pains, as the elaborate instructions and 
the long letters which he has left behind prove. 

The vast kingdom of China appealed to his charity, and he 
was resolved to risk his life to force an entry when God took 
him to Himself, and he died, like Moses, in sight of the land 
of promise. 

This great saint was born in Navarre, at the castle of Xavier, 
eight leagues from Pampelona, in 1506, and he died, under 
the circumstances related, in 1552. His feast is celebrated 
on the third of December. As Butler tells us, " He was so abso 
lute a master of his passions that he knew not what it was to 
have the least motion of anger and impatience, and in all events 
was perfectly resigned to the divine will, from whence proceeded 
an admirable tranquillity of soul, a perpetual cheerfulness in 
the midst of physical pains and other troubles, and equality of 
countenance. By humility the saint was always ready to follow 
the advice of others, and attributed all blessings to their prayers, 
which he most earnestly solicited. The union of his soul with 
God by holy prayer raised him above the world. Engulfed in 
deep meditations, he was sometimes found suspended in the 
air, with beams of glory round his countenance, as many ocular 
witnesses deposed." 

Some are specially called to work for souls, but there is no 
one who can not help much in their salvation. Holy example, 
earnest prayer, the offerings of our actions and sufferings in 
their behalf all this needs only the spirit which animated 
St. Francis Xavier, the desire to give glory to God, the love of 
God, and the love of our neighbor.

all the affection of my nature the infinite tenderness of Him 
Who conceals His glory and His Majesty, that He may dwell

PRAYERS OF A RELIGIOUS IN PRESENCE OF THE BLESSED 
SACRAMENT. 

Before the Adoration. 

OMY divine Saviour, behold me prostrate at Thy feet 
to adore Thy Sacred Heart, and repair the outrages 
which it incessantly receives. It is Thy voice which calls 
me, and may my obedience supply for my unworthiness; 
for who am I, O my God! that I should fulfil on earth the 
sublime function of the angels in heaven. It is to them, 
and to all Thy saints, that I unite myself, O Lord, at this 



Prayers for 1 an ous Occasions. 1067 

moment, to adore and bless Thee, and to repeat from the 
bottom of my heart, praised, adored, and glorified be for 
ever the Sacred Heart of Jesus; I adore it as united t&amp;lt;&amp;gt; 
the Divinity; I love it as the principle and source of all 
Thy love for me; I honor it as the most amiable, the best, 
and the mildest of all hearts; I consecrate myself to adore 
it perpetually (by uniting myself to all those upon earth 
who are employed in this holy exercise), that I may con 
tinue to adore it for all eternity in heaven. Amen. 

After the Adoration. 

I RETURN Thee thanks, O my God! for permitting me 
to remain in Thy presence; I beseech Thee to pardon 
whatever negligence the want of a lively faith has caused. 
Do I not deserve the reproach Thou madest to Thy apostles 
"Could you not watch one hour with Me? " (Matt. xxvi. 40). 
A heart consecrated to Thee should have profited better 
of these precious moments. I thank Thee, O my God! 
for the graces Thou hast granted me, notwithstanding mv 
unworthiness. 

I leave thee with regret, O Heart of my Saviour; where 
can I be better than with thee? But I return to where 
thy divine will calls me; do not permit any interior or 
exterior dissipation to contradict the homages which I 
have offered, and which others are about to continue in my 
stead. I unite myself, O my God! to all that they shall 
say; I offer it to Thee to supply for all that was wanting to 
my fervor. I desire to atone, O divine Jesus, for all the 
crimes which dishonor Thy temples and altars, and foi 
the ingratitude with which Thy love is repaid. In the 
bitterness of my soul I call to mind the profanations of the 
Jews, of heretics who have pierced and trampled the sac 
ramental species under foot, the sacrileges of bad Christians, 
who have received them on an impure tongue, and into a 
criminal heart. With sorrow I recall my own tepidity and 
negligence in the participation of Thy Divine Sacrament. 
It is in these sentiments I depart from Thy sanctuary. The 
hope of speedily returning to Thy altar consoles me under 
the necessity of quitting Thy sacred presence. 

Heavenly spirits, who adore with me the God of glory 
really present in this sanctuary, present to Him this public 
act of my regret and love. 

O heart of Mary, which I also honor with my whole soul, 
heart most conformable to that of Jesus! O tender heart 
of my dear Mother, I conjure thee to present to thy divine 
Son our homages, vows,., and petitions. Amen.

ADORO TE DEVOTE. 

*TC=^ IDDEN God, devoutly I adore Thee, 
,-I-b Truly present underneath these veils: 
All my heart subdues itself before Thee, 
Since it all before Thee faints and fails. 

Not to sight, or taste, or touch be credit, 
Hearing only do we trust secure; 

I believe, for God the Son hath said it- 
Word of truth that ever shall endure. 

On the cross was veiled Thy Godhead s splendor 
Here Thy manhood lieth hidden too ; 

Unto both alike my faith I render, 
And, as sued the contrite thief, I sue. 

Though I look not on Thy wounds, with Thomas* 
Thee my Lord, and Thee my God I call ; 

Make me more and more believe Thy promise, 
Hope in Thee and love Thee over all.

Living Bread that givest life to man;

To a single drop of which is given

Grant me what I thirst for and implore, 

In the revelation of Thine essence, 
To behold Thy glory evermore.

praters for {Travelers. 

E Breviary contains prayers for travelers that have 
received the consecration of the Church and of cen 
turies the "Itinerary," which priests seldom fail to recite 
for themselves and their companions as often as they begin 
a journey. As it may seem rather long for general use, we 
give an abridgment for the use of those who may wish to 
know and learn it: 

Y the almighty and merciful Lord direct us on our 
journey; may He make it prosper and maintain us 
in peace. 

May the Archangel Raphael accompany us along the way, 
and may we return to our homes in peace, joy, and health. 

Lord, have mercy on us! Jesus Christ, have mercy on us! 
Lord, have mercy on us! 

Prayer. 

O God, Who didst cause the children of Israel to traverse 
the Red Sea dryshod; Thou Who didst point out by a star 
to the Magi the road that led them to Thee; grant us, we 
beseech Thee, a prosperous journey and propitious weather; 
so that, under the guidance of Thy holy angels, we may 
safely reach that journey s end, and later the haven of eternal 
salvation. 

Hear, O Lord, the prayers of Thy servants. Bless their 
journeyings. Thou who art everywhere present, shower 
everywhere upon them the effects of Thy mercy; so that, 
insured by Thy protection against all dangers, they may 
return to offer Thee their thanksgiving. Through Jesus 
Christ our Lord. Amen. 

Those who have a special confidence in St. Joseph may make 
use of the following prayer which solicits also supernatural 
graces, and especially that of traveling always in the way of the 
Commandments, so as ultimately to reach the celestial terminus. 

O blessed St. Joseph, who didst accompany Jesus and 
Mary in all their journeys, and who hast therefore merited 
to be called the patron of all travelers, accompany us in 
this journey that we are about to undertake. Be our guide 



1072 Pravers for Various Occasions. 

and our protector ; watch over us ; preserve us from all acci 
dents and dangers to soul and body; support us in our 
fatigue, and aid us to sanctify it by offering it to God. Make 
us ever mindful that we are strangers, sojourners here below ; 
that heaven is our true home; and help us to persevere on 
the straight road that leads thereunto. We beseech thee 
especially to protect and aid us in the last great voyage 
from time to eternity, so that, under Thy guidance, we 
may reach the realm of happiness and glory, there to re 
pose eternally with thee in the company of Jesus and Mary. 
Amen. 

Still another prayer for travelers, asking in a special manner 
for the protection of the guardian angels, was composed by the 
saintly Mgr. Dupanloup. It reads: 

O almighty and merciful God, Who hast commissioned 
Thy angels to guide and protect us, command them to be our 
assiduous companions from our setting out until our return ; to 
clothe us with their invisible protection ; to keep from us all 
danger of collision, of fire, of explosion, of falls and bruises; 
and finally, having preserved us from all evil, and especially 
from sin, to guide us to our heavenly home. Through 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

Another not less beautiful prayer runs thus : 

My holy angel guardian, ask the Lord to bless the journey 
which I undertake, that it may profit the health of my soul 
and body; that I may reach its end; and that, returning 
safe and sound, I may find all at home in good health. Do 
thou guard, guide, and preserve us. Amen. 

The following couplet was a favorite ejaculation of Columbus: 

Jesus cum Maria Jesus and Mary, we pray, 

Sit nobis in via. Be with us ever on our way. 

One should not fail at least to make the sign of the cross on 
beginning a journey. The neglect or performance of such acts 
of piety may make all the difference between having our names 
figure on the list of "killed and wounded" in some railway 
catastrophe, and having them appear as those of passengers 
" saved by a miracle." (Ave Maria Press.) 

PRAYER BEFORE VISITING THE SICK. 

*Tr* OFFER to Thee, O my heavenly Spouse! all the ser- 
JL vices which I shall render to the poor until the last 
moment of my life. That my actions may be more accept 
able, I unite them to Thy infinite merits; vouchsafe to

accept of them, and to purify all my motives; I consecrate 
all to Thee, and humbly implore Thy assistance to over 
come every obstacle which self-love, predilection, vanity, 
disgust, sloth, or tepidity may oppose to the fulfilment of 
my duties. I wish to renew my consecration to serve and 
assist them for the future with the same faith and ardor as if I 
saw Thee really present. Give me, O Lord, strength and 
courage to accomplish my desire. Amen. 

PRAYER BEFORE SCHOOL.* 

OU, O Lord, art my strength and my patience, my 
light and my counsel; Thou confidest unto me the 
children whom I am appointed to instruct. O leave me not 
a single moment to myself, but give me, for their guidance 
and my own sanctification, the spirit of wisdom and of 
understanding, of counsel and of fortitude, of knowledge and 
of piety; and above all, the spirit of Thy holy fear, and an 
ardent zeal for Thy greater glory. I unite my labors to 
those of my divine Redeemer, and I beseech the immaculate 
heart of Mary, the Refuge of sinners, and all the holy angels 
and saints, to assist me this day in the performance of all 
my duties. Amen. 

PRAYERS TO BE SAID ALOUD BEFORE GIVING INSTRUCTION. 

*T)REVENT, we beseech Thee, O Lord, our actions bv 
r -l _ Thy holy inspirations, and carry them on by Thy 
gracious assistance, that every prayer and work of ours 
may begin always from Thee, and by Thee be happily 
ended, to Thy greater honor and glory. Through Jesus 
Christ our Lord. Amen. (Say one Hail Mary.) 

PETITION FOR HELP. 

(May be said privately before giving instructions.} 

O DIVINE Jesus! I go in Thy name and for Thy love. 
Give me Thy Spirit, and teach me how to instruct 
these children according to Thy most holy will. Amen.

sentiment that would be in the least displeasing to Thee. 
Teach me Thyself what I ought to say. "Set a watch, O 
Lord, before my mouth, and a door round about my lips " 
(Ps. cxl. 3), so that I may be prudent and charitable in 
conversation, and likewise edifying from the desire of ad 
vancing Thy honor and glory. Amen. 

PRAYER. 

(Which may be said on returning from School, Mission, In 
structions, or any other duty.) 

CCEPT, my dear Lord and Master, the duty I have 
just performed. Pardon the faults I have com 
mitted in doing it. I hope, with the assistance of Thy grace, 
to be more faithful in future. If it be Thy holy will, dear 
Lord, give success to my humble efforts to serve Thee, and 
grant that they may be always for the greater glory of Thy 
holy name. Amen. 

Or the following may be said: 

LOW me not, O Lord, to spoil Thy work, but let 
Thy Sacred Heart teach me to do it in the way most

be always upon us, through Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

Inflame my heart with the fire of Thy love, and enlighten 
me with Thy wisdom and Thy knowledge. 

Oh, let Thy loving Heart be to me my strength in temp

faculties and powers of her soul, all the senses and members 
of her body her whole being may be offered a holocaust 
of praise and honor to the divine Majesty during her whole 
life, and at the hour of her death. And in that awful hour,

DAILY PRAYER FOR THOSE WHO CARRY AN AGNUS DEI.* 

77ESUS, my Saviour, true Lamb of God, that takest away 
J the sins of the world, by Thy infinite mercy I beseech 
Thee to pardon my iniquities. By Thy sacred Passion, I 
beseech Thee, preserve me this day from sin and shield me 
from all evil. To Thy honor and glory, I carry about with 
me this blessed Agnus Dei, as a protection to my soul and 
to my body, and as an incentive to the practice of the virtues 
which Thou hast inculcated, especially of meekness, humility, 
purity, and charity. 

In memory of that sacrifice of love which Thou didst 
offer for me and all mankind on Calvary, I consecrate my 
w r hole being to Thee. 

Thou didst die on the cross for love of me; let me die to 
self for love of Thee! Keep me in Thy love and in Thy 
grace to the end of my life, that I may bless Thee forever 
with the saints in heaven. 

PRAYER TO OUR LADY, MOTHER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE. 

O IMMACULATE Virgin Mary, Mother of Divine Providence, 
take possession of my soul with all the fulness of thy favor 
and protection. Govern thou my life, and direct it along the 
way of virtue to the fulfilment of the divine will. Do thou 
obtain for me the pardon of my sins; be my refuge, my protection, 
my defense, _ my guide in the pilgrimage of this life; console 
me in afflictions, sustain me in dangers, and in the storms of 
adversity afford me the security of thy guardianship. Obtain

affections which hinder the efficacy of thy patronage. O sweetest 
Mother of Providence, turn thy maternal regard upon me, 
and if through frailty or malice I have provoked the menaces

PETITION TO ST. VINCENT DE PAUL. 

OMOST blessed and glorious St. Vincent de Paul! the 
model of evangelical perfection, permit us to join 
our thanksgivings for the favors bestowed on thee, to the 
transports which will eternally overflow thy pure soul. We 
thank the Almighty for having crowned thy profound humility 
and indefatigable zeal with eternal glory, and we beseech 
thee, by that tender charity which on earth would have 
made thee sacrifice a thousand lives to save one soul, to 
obtain for us that simplicity, mortification, and humility, 
that ardent zeal for the salvation of others, and constant 
union with God, which were thy favorite virtues, and which 
are the essence of our holy vocation. Ask for us, O blessed 
saint, the helps and cooperations of which we are in need, 
for promoting God s glory and for aiding the poor of Christ, 
whom thou didst love so exceedingly while on earth. 
Obtain for every member of our Community those virtues 
which are required for our own perfection, while we labor for 
the good of others. Offer up thy prayers also for our par 
ticular intention [N. N.] Accept, O great saint, our united 
homage, which is far short or that which thy virtues deserve, 
and teach us to become, like thee, all things to all, that we may 
gdin all for Christ. Amen. 

St. Vincent exhorted the Sisters of Charity often to say: 

PESTROY in me, O Lord, all that is displeasing to Thee, 
and grant that I may no longer be so full of myself. 
Grant that in each of my actions I may have no other desire 
than that of pleasing Thee.

For those in charge of Children. 

*TJ*CCUSTOM yourself to suffer in order to obtain grace for 
cJr-1-, yourselves and the children who are in your charge. 
This suffering will come both from them and from yourselves, 
and will make you always practice virtue in some way or 
another for their sake. 

To succeed in training children you must strive to be self- 
possessed at all times, to be even in temper, and equitable 
in dealing justly with all. Virtue must be rather insinuated 
by example than daily enforced by punishment or constant 
admonition. 

Lead children to love God; let them learn from your ex 
ample to sacrifice pleasure to duty. (Henriette D Ossemlle.) 

Y my life, my sweet Jesus, be spent in the peaceful 
endeavor of trying to lead Thy "little ones" to 
know and to love Thee, and when I am weary and sick at 
heart and I long for rest and repose, may I ever find it in 
Thy sacramental presence, in the pure joy of the Holy 
Eucharist. Amen. 

What will afford you most consolation when you are on

and ardent devotion to the Sacred Heart of Him Who is to 
judge us." 

END OF RELIGIOUS LIFE. 

HE end for which you have entered religion is to become 
a new creature, and to become entirely transformed 
into Christ crucified. The cross and humiliations of Jesus 
must be your only aim. You are elected to be the spouse 
of Christ crucified, to follow Him in hunger and thirst and 
poverty nay, even to death, for I hold out no other induce-

If His cross and His love will not content you, I have nothing 
nore to offer." 

" Is any cross too heavy, 
Or any task too hard 
That Jesus lays upon thee, 
And Jesus will reward?" 

PRAYER TO JESUS CRUCIFIED. 

O SWEET Jesus, mayest Thou be ever crucified in 
my heart by nails of love, Who for love of me wast 
crucified with nails of iron to the hard wood of the cross. 

I will draw near to my suffering Saviour; I will be sorrow 
ful with my sorrowful Jesus, broken-hearted with my broken 
hearted Jesus, and, above all, I will try to console Him, 
by promising in future to love Him more ardently, and to imi 
tate Him more closely. Amen. 

EXTRACT. 

QAINTAIN always the sense and posture of heart of 
a novice under training; and this very sense will 
be a great protection to your spirit, and will keep you open 
to correction and formation. 

As novices you considered yourselves as aiming and striv 
ing at being what you were not as yet : a Religious who 
maintains this posture of soul with this sentiment is the 
only true disciple of religion the only one who gains new 
iigh; an;l makes new progress. (Bishop Ullathorne.) 

MY LESSOR.

Only to do His will; 
Only to be what He made me, 
Though I be nothing still. 

Never a look beyond me, 

Out of a little sphere 
If I could fill another, 

God would not keep me here. 

Only to take what He gives me, 

Meek as a little child ; 
Questioning naught of the reason 

Joyful, or reconciled.

Only to do what He bids me, 

Patiently, gladly to-day, 
Taking no thought for the morrow

Only to look to Him ever ; 

Only to sit at His feet; 
All that He sayeth, to do it 

Then shall my life be complete,

ACT OF CONTRITION FOR RELIGIOUS 

God, I come to Thee to beg contrition for my sins 
for all my sins. Give me, I entreat Thee, true sorrow

Thou hast seen in the observance of my holy vows, and the 
little effort I have made to live in the spirit of my vocation. 
Filled with shame and sorrow, I come to renew my vows 
at Thy sacred feet, and I humbly implore of Thy infinite 
goodness and mercy that Thou wilt vouchsafe to admit this 
holocaust as an odor of sweetness, and that as Thou hast

also bestow plentiful grace on me to fulfil it. Amen. 

PEACE IN UNION WITH GOD. 

/^[l VE to each thing, no mailer what, the perfection it reason- 
XzJ ably requires, or that in the circumstances you can give 
it; then suppose your part done, dismiss the whole affair from 
your mind, and go on to the next. . . . Avoid re-examina 
tions springing from dissatisfaction with self. . . . Once 
the duty done, a5 it presents itself at the time, go on without 
worry. This is a kind of exterior hold upon God keep it 
firm. 

The interior one is all-important. That consists in receiv 
ing every variety of apparent accident people s virtues and 
vices, and the rough and smooth of events believe all as 
direct agencies intended for your sanctification, ordered and 
shaped and sent for the purpose of union. In fact, even your 
imperfections, when you think of them, you may well say 
were permitted for the same purpose; and to speak more 
strongly, but not incorrectly you may even be thankful for 
them, as the occasion of contrition and new resolve. . . . 

At once begin the formation of the soul on these principles, 
and keep everything else outside I mean everything that 
flings the smallest shadow on peace. 

Extracts from /toasters in tbe Spiritual Xife.* 

E Religious who does not make progress in 
perfection, goes backward. What was thy object 

in entering religion? Know thyself. Overcome thyself. 

Thy business is to please God in all things. His love and 

His grace are sufficient for thee. He serves not God who 

seeks consolation in the Religious state. 

2. He who loves poverty possesses all things. Of worldly 
things choose the worst and of heavenly things the best. 

He is not poor, who does not wish to feel the effects of 
poverty. Aim at the spirit of poverty. To have the name 
of being poor, and, at the same time, to enjoy the comforts 
of wealth, is to deceive men. 

3. He is not chaste who does not flee the occasions of 
impurity. 

Why dost thou wish to see that which has no value in thy 
eyes? Modesty of the eyes preserves from many sins and is 

* From the writings of Father Schneider, S.J. 



1084 Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

the mother of piety. "Chaste and gentle make us," so the 
Church sings to Our Lady. Woe to the Religious who is ill- 
tempered among the pious. It is better to bear an injury in 
silence and without murmur, than to fast on several days till 
evening. 

4. That Religious is not obedient, who, whilst exteriorly 
submitting graciously to orders, contradicts and murmurs 
interiorly, and criticises the Superior. 

The devil plays hand-ball with a vain and unmortified 
Religious. No one is more happy under the sun than the 
Religious who loves God, his Superior, and his cell, or the 
silence and solitude of the cloister. 

5. The supposition that in another convent, under another 
vSuperior, among other companions, in another employment, 
in other circumstances, one would make greater progress 
and be better satisfied, has already deceived many. Some 
in a few years have tried every kind of change consecutively, 
without becoming better, more happy, or more contented. 
God has placed us where we are; let us remain where we 
now are until it shall please Him to call us away. Where 
in the world is there a rose without thorns? 

6. That Religious is not yet dead to the world who is 
greatly concerned or anxious about his relatives and friends 
in the world. 

7. The Religious who strives after perfection should 
willingly and fervently embrace all that is painful, burdet* 
some, and disagreeable, all that requires combats, self -restraint , 
and self-denial. He should, indeed, prefer these to all that 
is agreeable to the sensual man. He should never hearken 
to the seductive voice of nature, but always follow the inspira 
tions of grace leading to life eternal. 

8. I shall be a true child of my Order as long as I am 
candid and sincere toward my Superior. 

I will never bother myself about offices that may be later 
intrusted to me, but will abandon myself to God s designs 
and put my trust in Him alone. 

9. I will follow the Community and avoid all singularity. 

10. I will be as careful of the honor of my Order as any one 
can be of his own. 

11. Beware of being a burden and a cross to thy Superiors 
or to any one else, but strive to give pleasure to all. 

12. In my Institute I will consider myself as a beggar 
admitted out of charity. 

13. What doth it avail me to live long in my Order if I 
do not attain its object and end? 

14. In the convent I am not the master, but the servant

of all, and in this should my honor and glory consist. For 
how should I wish to rule, since Jesus Christ came, not to 
be served, but to serve us, and the Blessed Virgin called 
herself only the handmaid of the Lord. 

15. If thou wishest to know whether thou lovest thy 
vocation, examine whether thou lovest mortification. Thy 
vocation is to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, and how canst 
thou be His disciple, if thou dost not wish to be crucified 
with Him? 

1 6. I will spare no effort to maintain a constant peace 
and interior joy. 

17. The renunciation of self-love is a mortification, by 
virtue of which thou actest not as thou likest either inte 
riorly or exteriorly, but only according to the good pleasure 
of God and of thy Superiors. 

1 8. Meekness is a sure sign of innocence preserved or 
recovered. 

19. Precipitateness and restlessness do not contribute to 
the success of a good work. To desire its success is good, but 
it should be without anxiety. 

20. God occupies Himself with me, as if I were alone in the 
world. It is also meet that I should occupy myself with 
Him, as if besides Him there were nobody and nothing in 
the universe. 

21. Meditate often on the Passion of Jesus Christ, thy 
King. He endured torments only to win thee and thy heart. 

22. Be truly humble, and thou wilt never think that any 
injustice is done to thee. He has only the appearance of 
humility who, though he humbles himself, can not bear to be 
humbled by others. If thou wishest to learn and know 
something very useful, learn and love to be unknown and to 
be considered as nothing. 

23. Do not complain of pains, sufferings, and adversity 
before casting a glance at thy crucifix and thinking on the 
twofold eternity. He makes the greatest progress in Religious 
life and virtue who manfully strives to overcome whatever 
he finds most difficult and disagreeable. 

24. Incense emits no odor nor ascends upward, unless it 
burns; and it is in suffering that we prove our love of God 
and our fidelity to Him. The road to the Mount of Olives is 
steep indeed; but the Mount of Olives is also the Mount of 
the Ascension. Those who suffer with Jesus Christ will be 
also glorified with Him. 

25. When we have once so far progressed as no longer to 
seek any human consolation, we then begin to relish spiritual 
and heavenly things. 



io86 Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

26. We should not imagine we are able to please every 
body. 

27. We should expect a just return, not from men, but 
from God alone. 

28. We should observe in our neighbor only his virtues and 
advantages, and in ourselves only our faults and imper 
fections. 

29. He who severely judges his own deeds, finds no reason 
to condemn others, but is inclined rather to excuse them. 

30. If thou wishest to live in great tranquillity and true 
peace, thy most ardent desires should be to see God in the 
next life, thy greatest fear to lose Him, thy most bitter pain 
not yet to enjoy Him, and thy greatest joy all that can lead 
thee to Him. 

31. Free thy heart from all that is created and seek God 
alone, and thou shalt find Him. 

32. Severity toward ourselves should render us more 
meek, indulgent, and affable toward others. If our neigh 
bor s act has one hundred sides, we should always look at it 
from its most favorable side. When the sinfulness of an act 
no longer admits of vindication, we should at least seek to 
excuse it and admit that the intention was good. But if this 
is impossible, we should at least make allowance for the vio 
lence of the temptation, for the ignorance, impulsiveness, or 
human frailty of the one who committed the fault. 

33. We should flee nothing more carefully than sloth, 
sadness, and dangerous familiarities. 

34. To bear cheerfully, gratefully, and lovingly the daily 
little inconveniences that are inseparable from our vocation, 
is a constant and most profitable exercise of mortification. 

35. I will consider and employ each day as if it were my last; 
one day shall surely be my last; but which one? 

36. Thy spiritual progress is in proportion to thy self- 
denial. 

37. Attend to thyself. What others do is no concern of 
thine. Follow Jesus Christ. 

38. Thou art as great and as good as thou art before God 
neither more nor less. 

39. Beware lest, on account of thy negligence, God take 
away from thee the tenderness of thy conscience, and leave 
it insensible in thee. 

40. With the utmost fervor I will venerate the Most 
Blessed Sacrament, the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, 
and my guardian angel. 

41. I will often during the day raise my heart to God by 
short and fervent aspirations and the renewal of a pure 
intention. 



Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 1087 

42. I will most carefully abstain from judging others and 
mingling in their concerns. What I can not excuse I will com 
passionate, considering my own weakness and sinfulness, and 
saying a Hail Mary for the amendment of the culprit. 

43. I will always speak to every one in a friendly, respect 
ful, and humble manner. 

44. My soul, what doth it profit thee to be loved by men, 
if, like Pilate, thou losest the friendship of Jesus Christ, on 
account of that love or popularity ? 

45. He who diligently considers Our Lord s life and Pas 
sion will find in abundance therein all that is useful and neces 
sary for his spiritual life. 

46. I will carefully consider what I have to do, and not 
what others are doing. 

47. Accustom thyself to excuse others out of true charity, 
and to be thoughtful of their welfare in all things. 

48. Be but little in thine own eyes, and desire to be also 
thus considered; and w r hen thou art so treated, be not sad, 
but rejoice. All for Jesus. 

* 49. To plod on perseveringly and faithfully when we 
are under a dark cloud, and can not see our way, no, not one 
step before us, still to toil on in trust and love, this is to 
give glory to God and joy to the Sacred Heart. 

50. When you go to your holy communion to-morrow, 
think that you see the divine Child looking through and 
through you with His clear pellucid gaze and asking you 
the question, "Will you be true?" Are you resolved to 
combat resolutely the visible faults all can see and be scan 
dalized by, instead of the half-dozen imaginary ones with 
which you love so much to torture yourselves? And I 
should love, I should dearly love you to return His glance 
with one as limpid and as true, saying, "O Lord, no one 
knows better than I how blind and weak I am, but I wish 
to know, I wish to see, what Thou desirest of me, and will try 
with all my heart, regardless of all obstacles, to accomplish 
it." He wishes you to be real. Be real. 

51. Jesus is our Lover and a jealous One. We must 
be blind if we dare look at Him with a heart attached to 
anything but Himself. He is our King, and as such, claims 
undisputed possession of our All. Sacrifice and struggle! 
this is the consummation of the life of a good Religious. 

52. If you don t reverence Silence, you will lose prayer, 
recollection, holy inspirations. Get the habit of talking to 
God about everything. 



* From the writings of Father Dignam, S.J. 



io88 Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

53. Remember God loves offerings made in joy, and the 
cream of our offerings is to show joy when tried. If contra 
dictions and annoyances come, let us try to offer a fervent, 
ioyful act of thanksgiving that God has given us an oppor 
tunity of practicing virtue. 

54. The praises of men pass. Let us seek only to glorify 
God in our work, taking cheerfully success or failure as He 
chooses to send it. Work, then, only for the eternal salva 
tion of your charges that by Him they may be saved, while 
you remain hidden and unknown. 

55. Every time we lift ourselves up, either before others 
or only in our own minds, we frighten Jesus away. He has 
so keen an eye and so sensitive a heart that He can not 
bring Himself to find a home in a soul possessed by self and 
pride. 

56. Here is a test of your honesty. We know we can not 
trust ourselves to crush self. Are we willing that others 
should do the business for us, or do we resist? If we take 
little slights, neglects, contempts well, patiently, nay, 
even willingly, looking on each as a treasure God gives us to 
bring us nearer to Him, to destroy His enemy our own 
self-love then we are really aiming at His love. 

57. The spirit of St. Francis of Sales the "omnia omnibus 
factus sum" of St. Paul, by which, by cruelty to self, you 
become sweet to everybody is but little understood; but 
you must understand it, and put your whole heart into the 
work 

58. Duty without piety is meat without salt, but piety 
without duty is salt without meat. Let pious gluttons 
look to it. 

59. God speaks still, as He spoke to our fathers in primi 
tive times when there were neither directors nor direction. 
Spirituality then consisted in doing the will of God. Each 
hour brings a duty to be done with fidelity. Attention to 
this made saints, and makes saints still. 

60. Life is a series of steps, each one bringing us nearer 
to the awful moment when we shall kneel at Qur Lord s 
feet, and look up inquiringly into His eyes. 

61. The life that has been spent in industry and striving, 
and which is yet a failure, is the nearest approach to that 
of Christ, for what was His life, viewed only with external 
eyes, but a great failure? 

62. St. Joseph did not suffer martyrdom. What made 
him the greatest of saints and promoters? (i) God s will 
was enough to make him happy. He had no other desires. 
Poverty, monotony, labor, labor without praise, was sweet 



Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 1089 

to him if it was God s will. (2) Hence he was meek and 
obedient without asking why. (3) Zeal with little oppor 
tunity came out in prayer. A perfect promoter was St. 
Joseph. 

63. To have a smile for all is a great means of doing good. 
But only those who try know how hard it is. We shall 
succeed better if we learn to smile at God; for He, dear 
Lord, loves to see us smile at Him, and, like His creatures, 
He is pleased with our cheerfulness. 

64. The vows are the irrevocable acceptance of all the 
blessedness of my creatureship, of all that God desires in 
creating me, that I should be to Him and He to me. They 
put me out that He may reign. Poverty means that I know 
that while He gives, I, and His gift no less, belong to Him 
and must. That having received it as a mendicant I am 
just the same mendicant when in possession, and that this 
is as true of His caresses as of the food I eat. 

65. Chastity means that the God-Man loves me all, longs 
to possess me all, whom He made ; loves the body of which He 
took the likeness for me, and delights in the consecration of 
it to Himself, and in its immolation by the imitation of His 
poverty, labor, and austerity. 

66. Obedience I do not think will ever be perfect till we 
sincerely think each one better than ourselves, and this 
practically and in the individual. We talk about reverencing 
God in Superiors. We can not do it until we are, as I say, 
sincere about reverencing God in every one else. Obedience 
js the presence of God. 

67. Always pray at holy communion to overcome your 
predominant passion or any weakness which disedifies 
others; let it be verified that the idols fall down before Our 
Lord in the Egypt of your heart. 

68. After a fall the first thing is to say: " Bonum est mihi " 
then, "Peccavi" "Domine, miserere mei": then, "Cor 
contritum non despicies": and lastly: "Dixi nunc coepi." 

69. It is not success but courage that is wanted. It is 
the looking up to Our Lord after every fall and saying spon 
taneously: "Failed again. I ll try again." This touches 
Him. He is conquered at last. 

70. "Cultivate sweetness," says that most perfect of pro 
moters, St. Francis of Sales. " I do not say be soft and 
easy, but be gentle and sweet." So we may notice that the 
saint saw all the difference between the two. 

71. Some of us, alas, are less ashamed to be selfish than 
to be thought so. Let us be brave and resolute; we shall 
obtain the priceless grace to be truly unselfish through 



logo Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

Mary s Heart. Say to her lovingly: "O Queen of the 
Apostleship of Prayer, make us unselfish; make us worthy 
promoters of the Sacred Heart." 

72. Mother most pure, Mother most holy and most kind, 
may the love of Jesus and of thee grow in our hearts to 
gether; may that love make us hate sin and the world, 
strengthen us to deny ourselves, confirm our faith, hope, 
and charity, and bring Thee, sweet Mother, to our death 
beds to console our last hour. 

73. Devotion to the Sacred Heart means to be convinced 
of His personal love for me, to return it by personal love, 
and so (for this is the nature of personal love) to be glad when 
He is honored to be sorry when He is dishonored to 
make Him what reparation I can for the injuries done to 
Him by men. 

74. To brood over our sufferings is poison to the soul, so 
also is pondering over the faults of others. Count as a fault 
each time you think of any one s faults without thinking of 
their good qualities and praising God for them. We were 
created to praise. 

75. How peaceful will be the death of one who has never 
allowed himself to judge or say an unkind word! He will 
find at his judgment the Sacred Heart to be an open taber 
nacle where he will rest for ever. 

76. It was as she (Our Lady of Sorrows) watched the last 
sufferings of her Beloved, that she learnt that immense 
compassion, that boundless pity which made her the Mother 
of the Apostles, the Refuge of sinners, the Promoter of the 
Sacred Heart s love for souls. If we make her sorrows our 
own, compassion will grow in our hearts, and make us like 
to her. 

77. Make it the fixed purpose of your life to make all, 
others happy as far as it is in your power, and so (for that 
will be necessary) to put self out of view altogether. This 
then ought to be the first thought on awaking: "Dear 
Mother, for Thy honor I will take care that everybody who 
speaks to me to-day shall go away happier." This thought 
to be the first thought in your examen at night: "How 
many have I failed to make happy to-day?" 

78. Simplicity of intention, setting our hearts on accom 
plishing God s will alone, and minding neither reputation, 
popularity, comfort nor success this is the only way to gain 
peace. 

79. If we look back on our lives we shall find that the 
heaviest cross that was ever laid upon us, which seemed at 
the time to crush us to the very earth, was in reality the 



Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 1091 

beginning of God s mercy for us and the turning point in 
our lives. 

80. If Jesus Christ is to be born in our hearts it can only 
be accomplished through death to self. It is not by one 
good act that self is destroyed it is by reiterated efforts, a 
long and slow death after many wounds. 

* 81. The right and wrong of things turns exactly on 
the intention. 

82. Perfection means aiming at the highest. 

83. The time of adversity is the time to turn to God 
quickly; the sooner I turn to Him, the happier I shall be 
Why should I bear pain alone, if God is willing to share it 
with me. God will always sympathize with us if Ht 
does not always give consolation, He always gives strength. 

84. We must take everything to God not only big things. 
but little ones too each occurrence, each little disappoint 
ment, whether in the natural or supernatural order all has 
to go to God, and humility takes us there. How happy 
adversity is when it is the instrument that takes us to God! 
Whatever happened to our blessed Saviour was an in 
ducement to Kim to turn to His heavenly Father He 
never wearied in that it was the passion of His life. 

85. God is strong enough and loving enough to take us 
entirely into His own hands If God has taken away success, 
regard it as a blessed piece of destitution. 

86. How are we going to feel when judged favorably, or 
unfavorably? some people seem to live by the judgment 
of others. Are we living that we may stand well in the 
judgment of others? Human respect is the most entangling 
thing will it be an answer to almighty God? Is the esteem 
of others the end we are setting before ourselves? It is a 
wrong standard we must do our actions so that Our Father 
who is in heaven may be pleased. The people who are truly 
free are those who have no human respect and go straight to 
God. 

87. There is no love that increases so fast as that which 
costs. 

88. If we concentrate all our attention on one thing it will 
all be well; much better to have all our eneigies concen 
trated than dissipated. 

89. When anything goes against the grain it ought to be 
done more briskly. 

90. Our Lord avails Himself of His power to humble 



* From the writings of Father Morris, S.J. 



1 092 Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

Himself to the utmost. No one entered the holy house of 
Nazareth without seeing that He was the last. He acted 
as one who had no rights, except to be the lowest of the low, 
though He was the Highest of the high. 

* 91. Believe me, my dear friends, believe an experience 
ripened by thirty years in the sacred ministry. I do here 
affirm that all deceptions, all spiritual deficiencies, all mis 
eries, all falls, all faults, and even the most serious wander 
ings out of the right path, all proceed from this single source 
a want of constancy in prayer. Live the life of prayer; learn 
to bring everything, to change everything into prayer pains- 
and trials, and temptations of all kinds. 

Pray in the calm, pray in the storm ; 

Pray on awaking, and pray during the daytime; 

Going and coming, pray; 

Tired out and distracted, pray; 

Whatsoever your repugnance may be, pray; 

Pray, that you may learn to pray. 

"Teach us, O Lord, how to pray." 

"But I can not pray." That is heresy. Yes, you can 
always pray. If you feel a disgust, nay, a horror of prayer, 
pray on, pray in spite of yourself, against yourself. Beg 
for the courage in prayer which our agonizing Saviour merited 
for you by His pangs in Gethsemane and upon Calvary. 
Pray, for prayer is the strength which saves, the courage 
which perseveres, the mystic bridge, cast over the abyss, 
which joins the soul to God. 

t 92. You must be brave and carry your cross cheerfully, 
and leave yourself entirely in the hands of our dear Lord 
Often when you go to see Him, say the prayer of our holy 
Father: "Sume, Domine, et suscipe"; and the ejaculation: 
"In labore requies, in aestu temperies, in lletu solatium." 

93. If I feel inclined to be irritable, let me .turn to my 
foster-father, St. Joseph. With so many cares he was so 
patient, and gentle. 

94. Our dear Lord will not ^ outdone in generosity, and 
we poor sinners will meet with equal generosity if, like Mag- 
dalen, we approach Him in the same humble, sorrowing, 
loving, and generous dispositions. 

95. Our dear Lord was crowned with thorns to make 
amends for our disobedience and independence. Ah! get a 
great horror of the spirit of independence. Learn submission,

and try to comfort our dear Lord by being humble and 
obedient. 

Jesus appointed as the place of the Ascension the Mount 
of Olives, not Thabor, to teach us that the way to heaven is 
by suffering and the cross. 

His Blessed Heart is a very ocean of mercy. Peter and 
Thomas and Magdalen found it so. Then courage, my soul! 
I too shall find it so. 

96. Let us not forget that everything which Our Lord 
permits is intended for our real good, either directly or indi 
rectly, and consequently let us drink the chalice, for it is 
mixed and presented to us by Our Father. We must not 
think of reward, but we must work for love. 

97. Who can tell the sea of sorrow that burst upon that 
maiden of fifteen! Now she understands the prophecies. 
She sees Calvary before her, and murmurs: "I am in the 
hands of God; be it done unto me according to His word." 
Mary had to make a great sacrifice, and with a great heart 
she did it. When Our Lord asks us to make a sacrifice, we 
must try to imitate our Mother. "Of myself I can not; but 
I will lean upon Thee, O my God, and I will do it, come what 
will." Let our constant prayer be "Fiat voluntas tua," not 
in a spirit of repugnance or compulsion, but cheerfully, con- 
fidingly, and in a spirit of love. 

98. There is life and energy in the tabernacle, but there 
is no outward show or bustle. Let us try to learn from the 
Blessed Sacrament the right way to work with energy and 
constancy, and great peace. 

Outside the tabernacle, what is there that is worthy of 
our love? It is well for us, dear children, to take our stand 
by the tabernacle, and wrench our souls from all else. 

99. As to being misjudged, no doubt it is hard to suppress 
our wounded feelings; but when we put ourselves alone 
with our dearest elder Brother, and think how misjudged 
He was for our sake, and how cheerfully He bore it, and 
picture Him asking us to keep Him company, we soon nerve 
ourselves, not only to bear the suffering, but to be glad to do 
it for love of Him. Don t be afraid, dear child, that God 
will ask too much of you. He always asks for something 
that our nature will rebel against, but the pain of giving it 
lasts but a moment, and the pleasure is eternal. St. Igna 
tius says: "Labor to make ourselves indifferent," not "be 
indifferent," because Rome was not built in a day, and we 
shall not become indifferent in a day. Let us not decline 
to accept any trials which God may send us, no matter how 
repugnant to our nature, even though they may cause our 



IOQ4 Miscellaneous Extracts, Maxims, and Prayers. 

hearts to break. Jesus has drunk the chalice for us, let us 
drink it for Him. Be thorough in the service of your good 
God. 

100. How then should we employ our time? (i) We 
should keep steadily to our spiritual duties; (2) Fulfil the 
duties of our state of life ; (3) Do what we owe to our station ; 
(4) Fill up our spare time well ; (5) Do even our least actions 
in a spirit of faith and love. You will never feel any sacrifice 
if you love. Look at the intensity of love and the loyalty of 
the saints; these ought to be a stimulus for us. In all cir 
cumstances let our prayer be: "Non mea voluntas, sed Tua 
fiat." It will bring us strength and consolation, and will 
render us cheerful and ready to bear every hardship. 

Glory is only to be earned by the cross. 

OMY sweet Jesus, my Lord, my Redeemer, my ever 
devoted Brother, who for me and for my benefit 
never ceasest to expend Thyself, into Thy hands I resign 
the whole of my liberty, that I may be in future Thy bond 
slave; I consecrate to Thee my mind, my heart, my will, 
and every sense of my body. Please to take full possession 
of me, body and soul, and do with me whatever Thou wilt. 
Only one thing I beg in return: give me grace never to 
relax in my love for Thee, and then I shall live happy and 
die content. So be it, my Jesus! 

Eternal Father, Who through Thy beloved Son dost 
teach us ever to pray "Thy kingdom come," grant us, O 
Lord, through His most Sacred Heart the grace of final 
perseverance in Thy love, that having with entire devotion 
promoted the glory of that Sacred Heart on earth, we may 
share the more intimate favors of its love for all eternity. 
Amen.

Thee, for so many impious men and apostates who persecute 
Thee. By the fervor of our love we would wish to make amends

How happy should we be, O Jesus, could we but make repa

with my whole heart I adore and love Thee in the most august

perfection of which a reasonable creature is capable. Meantime 
I purpose now and ever to adore Thee, not only for those Catholics 
who adore and love Thee not, but also for the conversion of all 
bad Christians, and of all heretics, schismatics, Mohammedans,

3ST sacred Heart of Jesus! I adore Thee; I offer to 
Thee all that I am and all that I possess; I consecrate 
to Thee my soul with all its faculties, my body with all its senses, 
my heart with all its affections, desiring in all things to honor, 
love, and glorify Thee; in thanksgiving for the numberless 
benefits that I have received from Thee, especially in the Holy 
Eucharist; in atonement for my own sins as well as in repara 
tion for all the offenses that are committed against Thee in the 
sacrament of Thy love, and, finally, in humble supplication, 
that I may henceforth be faithful to Thee, that I may please 
Thee in thought, word, and deed, that I may suffer in patience 
and in perfect resignation to Thy holy will, that I may become 
like to Thee in meekness and humility, that I may persevere in 
Thy love and Thy grace to the end of my life, and that I may 
praise Thee and bless Thee with the saints and angels in eternity. 
We beseech Thee, also, O good Jesus, by Thy sacred Heart, 
overflowing with sweetness and mercy, to bless our Holy Father, 
the Pope, and our Holy Mother, the Church; to take under 
Thy special protection this congregation, our homes, our country, 
our rulers, our legislators, our bishops, our priests, and all 
Religious Orders. We recommend to Thee all our concerns, 
our friends, relatives, benefactors, and all those who have asked 
us to pray for them; those who are sick and those who are 
dying, and all who are under any affliction. Cast an eye of 
compassion on obstinate sinners and heretics and unbelievers. 

Give eternal rest to the faithful departed. 

Bless in particular the apostolic labors of those who are 
engaged in giving missions and retreats, in propagating the 
Faith in heathen lands, in spreading Thy kingdom on earth, 
and in fostering devotion to Thy most sacred Heart and to the 
Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar. Amen.

For the Sundays and Holy Days. 



FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 

"COLLECT I. Arise in Thy strength, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
and come: from the dangers which threaten us because of our 
sins, be Thy presence our sure defence, be Thy deliverance our 
safety for ever more. 

II. O God, Who wast pleased that at the message of an angel 
Thy Word should take flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary: grant that we, Thy suppliants, who believe her verily 
to be the Mother of God. may be helped by the prayers she puts 
up to Thee on our behalf. 

III. O God, the shepherd and governor of all the faithful, 
mercifully regard Thy servant N., whom it has pleased Thee 
to set up as chief pastor over Thy Church: give unto him, we 
beseech Thee, both by word and by example, to be of profit 
to all those under His charge, so that, together with the flock 
entrusted to him, he may attain to life everlasting. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xiii. 11-14. Brethren: Knowing the 
season, that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. 
For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed. 
The night is passed and the day is at hand. Let us there 
fore cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor 
of light. Let us walk honestly as in the day: not in riot 
ing and drunkenness, not in chambepvig and impurities, 
not in contention and envy; but put ye on the Lord Jesus 
Christ. 

GOSPEL. Luke xxi. 25-33. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: There shall be signs in the sun, and in the 
moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of 
nations, by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the 
sea and of the waves: men withering away for fear, and 
expectation of what shall come upon the whole world, 
for the powers of heaven shall be moved; and then they 
shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with great 
power and majesty. But when these things begin to 



i ii2 Epistles and Gospels. 

come to pass, look up and lift up your heads, because your 
redemption is at hand. And He spoke to them a simili 
tude: See the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they now 
shoot forth their fruit, you know that summer is nigh. 
So you also when you shall see these things come to pass, 
know that the kingdom of God is at hand. Amen I say 
to you, this generation shall not pass away till all things 
be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away: but 
My words shall not pass away. 

SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 

COLLECT. Stir up, O Lord, our hearts to make ready the ways 
of Thine only begotten Son; and with minds undenled to pay 
to Thee, through His coming, the homage of our service. Other 
Collects as on p. 1111. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xv. 4-13. Brethren: What things soever 
were written, were written for our learning: that through 
patience and the comfort of the Scriptures we might have 
hope. Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you 
to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus 
Christ: that with one mind, and with one mouth, you may 
glorify God and the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received 
you unto the honor of God. For I say that Christ Jesus 
was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, 
to confirm the promises made unto the fathers. But that 
the Gentiles are to glorify God for His mercy as it is writ 
ten: Therefore will I confess to Thee, O Lord, among the 
Gentiles, and will sing to Thy name. And again he saith: 
Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people. And again: Praise 
the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify Him, all ye peoples. 
And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and 
He that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in Him the Gen 
tiles shall hope. Now the God of hope fill you all with 
joy and peace in believing: that you may abound in hope, 
and in the power of the Holy Ghost. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xi. 2-10. At that time: When John 
had heard in prison the works of Christ, sending two of 
his disciples, he said to Him: Art Thou He that art to 
come, or look we for another? And Jesus making answer 
said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard 



Epistles and Gospels. 1113 

and seen. The blind see,* the lame walk, the lepers are 
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor have 
the Gospel preached to them: And blessed is he that 
shall not be scandalized in Me. And when they went 
their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concern 
ing John: What went you out into the desert to see? a 
reed shaken with the wind? But what went you out to 
see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold, they that 
are clothed in soft garments are in the houses of kings. 
But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I tell 
you, and more than a prophet. For this is he of whom it 
is written: Behold: I send My angel before Thy face, 
who shall prepare Thy way before Thee. 

THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 

COLLECT. Bow down Thine ear, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
to our prayers: and by the brightness of Thine Advent lighten 
the darkness of our minds. Others as on p. 1111. 

EPISTLE. Phil. iv. 4-7. Rejoice in the Lord always: 
again I say, rejoice. Let your modesty be known to all 
men. The Lord is nigh. Be nothing solicitous: but 
in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanks 
giving, let your petitions be made known to God. And 
the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, 
keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 

GOSPEL. John i. 10-28. At that time: The Jews 
sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to John to ask 
him: Who art thou? And he confessed and did not deny: 
and he confessed: I am not the Christ. And they asked 
him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am 
not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No. 
They said, therefore, unto him: Who art thou, that we 
may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest 
thou of thyself? He said: I am the voice of one crying 
in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, 
as said the prophet Isaias. And they that were sent were 
of the Pharisees. And they asked him and said to him: 
Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor 
Slias, nor the prophet? John answered them, saying: 
I baptize with water; but there hath stood One in the 



1 1 14 Epistles and Gospels. 

midst of you, Whom you know not. The same is He 
that shall come after me, Who is preferred before me; 
the latchet of Whose shoe I am not worthy to loose. These 
things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where 
John was baptizing. 



FOURTH SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 

COLLECT. Arise, we beseech Thee, O Lord, in Thy strength, 
and come in might to our aid; that, by the work of Thy grace, 
that good to which our sins are a sore hindrance, may, in the 
fulness of Thy forgiveness, speedily be vouchsafed to us. Others 
as on p. 1111 . 

EPISTLE, i Cor. iv. 7-5. Brethren: Let a man so 
account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dis 
pensers of the mysteries of God. Here now it is required 
among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful. But 
to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by 
man s day, but neither do I judge my own self. For I 
am not conscious to myself of anything: yet am I not 
hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord. 
Therefore judge not before the time, until the Lord come: 
Who both will bring to light the hidden things of dark 
ness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: 
and then shall every man have praise from God. 

GOSPEL. Luke Hi. 1-6. Now in the fifteenth year of 
the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor 
of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip 
his brother tetrarch of Iturea and the country of Trach- 
onitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilina, under the high- 
priests Annas and Caiphas: the Word of the Lord was 
made unto John the son of Zachary, in the desert. And 
he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching 
the baptism of penance for the remission of sins, as it was 
written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the prophet: 
A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the 
way of the Lord, make straight His paths. Every valley 
shall be filled: and every mountain and hill shall be brought 
low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough 
plain. And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1115 

CHRISTMAS DAY. 

MIDNIGHT MASS. 

COLLECT. O God, Who didst make this most sacred night 
to shine forth with the glory of Him Who is the true light of the 
world ; grant that He Who, thus revealed to us, has made re 
splendent our path on earth, may be for ever our joy and our 
light in heaven. 

EPISTLE. Titus ii. 11-15. Dearly Beloved: The grace 
of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men, instructing 
us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should 
live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, looking 
for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great 
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself 
for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and 
might cleanse to Himself a people acceptable, a pursuer 
of good works. These things speak, and exhort, in Christ 
Jesus our Lord. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 1-14. At that time: There went 
out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world 
should be enrolled. This enrolling was first made by 
Cyrinus, the governor of Syria: And all went to be 
enrolled, every one into his own city. And Joseph also 
went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into 
Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem: 
because he was of the house and family of David, to be 
enrolled with Mary his espoused wife, who was with child. 
And it came to pass, that when they were there, her days 
were accomplished, that she should be delivered. And 
she brought forth her first-born Son, and wrapped Him 
up in swaddling-clothes, and laid Him in a manger: because 
there was no room for them in the inn. And there were 
in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping 
the night-watches over their flock. And behold an angel 
of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God 
shone round about them, and they feared with a great 
fear. And the angel said to them: Fear not; for behold 
I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all 
the people; for this day is born to you a Saviour, Who 
is Christ the Lord, in the city of David. And this shall 
be a sign unto you. You shall find the Infant wrapped in 
swaddling-clothes, and laid in a manger. And suddenly 



in6 Epistles and Gospels. 

there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly 
army, praising God, and saying: Glory to God in the 
highest : and on earth peace to men of good will. 

THE MASS AT DAYBREAK. 

COLLECT. Bathed in the new light brought upon earth by 
Thine incarnate Word, we beseech Thee, O almighty God, to 
vouchsafe that the holy faith, which ever illumines our minds, 
may in all our actions shine forth to Thy glory before the 
world. 

EPISTLE. Titus Hi. 4-7. Dearly Beloved: The good 
ness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared: not by 
the works of justice, which we have done, but according 
to His mercy He saved us, by the laver of regeneration, 
and renovation of the Holy Ghost, Whom He hath poured 
forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our 
Saviour; that being justified by His grace, we may be 
heirs, according to hope, of life everlasting. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 15-20. At that time: After the 
angels departed from them into heaven the shepherds 
said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let 
us see this Word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath 
showed to us. And they came with haste: and they found 
Mary and Joseph, and the Infant lying in the manger. 
And seeing, they understood of the Word that had been 
spoken to them concerning this Child. And all that heard 
wondered: and at those things that were told them by 
the shepherds. But Mary kept all these words, ponder 
ing them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, 
glorifying and praising God, for all the things they had 
heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 

THE THIRD MASS. 

COLLECT. Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty God, that the 
new birth in the flesh of Thine only-begotten Son may set us 
free, who, because of the sometime slavery of our race, are 
still borne down under the yoke of sin-. 

EPISTLE. Heb. i. 1-12. God, Who at sundry times 
and in divers manners spoke in times past to the fathers 
by the prophets, last of all in these days, hath spoken to 
us by His Son, Whom He hath appointed heir of all things, 
by Whom also He made the world: Who being the bright 
ness of His glory, and the figure of His substance, and 



Epistles and Gospels. 1117 

upholding all things by the Word of His power, making 
purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty 
on high: being made so much better than the angels, 
as He had inherited a more excellent name than they. 
For to which of the angels hath He said at any time: 
Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee? And 
again: I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me 
a Son? And again, when He bringeth in the first-begotten 
into the world He saith: And let all the angels of God 
adore Him. And to the angels indeed He saith: He that 
maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of 
fire. But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever 
and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. 
Thou hast loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore 
God, Thy God hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness 
above Thy fellows. And: Thou in the beginning, O 
Lord, didst found the earth : and the works of Thy hands 
are the heavens. They shall perish, but Thou shalt con 
tinue, and they shall all grow old as a garment. And as 
a vesture shalt Thou change them and they shall be 
changed: but Thou art the self-same, and Thy years 
shall not fail. 

GOSPEL. John i. 1-14. In the beginning was the 
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was 
God. The same was in the beginning with God. All 
things were made by Him, and without Him was made 
nothing that was made. In Him was life, and the life 
was the light of men; and the light shineth in darkness, 
and the darkness did not comprehend it. There was a 
man sent from God whose name was John. This man 
came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that 
all men might believe through him. He was not the 
light, but was to give testimony of the light, that was the 
true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh 
into this world. He was in the world, and the world was 
made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came 
unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as 
many as received Him, He gave them power to be made 
the sons of God; to them that believe in His name. Who 
are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor 
of the will of man, but of God. And THE WORD WAS MADE 



iu8 Epistles and Gospels. 

FLESH, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, the 
glory as it were of the only-begotten of the Father, full 
of grace and truth. 

SUNDAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE OF CHRISTMAS. 

COLLECT. Almighty and everlasting God, guide, all our 
actions according to Thy good pleasure; so that we may abound 
in good works done in the name of Thy beloved Son, Our Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

EPISTLE. Gal. iv. 1-7. Brethren: As long as the 
heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though 
he be lord of all: but is under tutors and governors until 
the time appointed by the father: so we also, when we 
were children, were serving under the elements of the world. 
But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent His 
Son, made of a woman, made under the law, that He 
might redeem them who were under the law, that we might 
receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, 
God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, cry 
ing, Abba, Father. Therefore now he is not a servant, 
but a son. And if a son, an heir also, through God. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 33-40. At that time Joseph, and 
Mary, the Mother of Jesus, were wondering at those 
things, which were spoken concerning Him. And Simeon 
blessed them, and said to Mary, His mother: Behold this 
Child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many 
in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted. And 
thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that out of many hearts 
thoughts may be revealed. And there was one Anna, 
a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of 
Aser: she was far advanced in years, and had lived with 
her husband seven years from her virginity. And she 
was a widow until four-score and four years; who departed 
not from the Temple, by fastings and prayer serving night 
and day. Now she at the same hour coming in, con 
fessed to the Lord; and spoke of Him to all that looked 
for the redemption of Israel. And after they had performed 
all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned 
into Galilee, to their city Nazareth. And the Child grew, 
and waxed strong, full of wisdom: and the grace of God 
was in Him. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1119 

THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD. 

COLLECT. O God, Who, through the fruitful virginity of 
blessed Mary, hast assured to mankind the blessings of life 
eternal; grant, we beseech Thee, that she, in whom our race 
was found worthy to receive the Author of Life, may plead 
unceasingly for us to the same Our Lord Jesus Christ. 

EPISTLE. Titus ii. 11-15. Dearly Beloved: The grace 
of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men, instructing 
us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should 
live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world, looking 
for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great 
God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself 
for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and might 
cleanse to Himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good 
works. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with 
all authority. Let no man despise thee. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 21. At that time: After eight days 
were accomplished that the Child should be circumcised: 
His name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, 
before He was conceived in the womb. 

VIGIL OF EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT AND EPISTLE. Same as on Sunday within Octave of 
Christmas. 

GOSPEL. Matt, ii 19-23. At that time: When Herod 
was dead, behold an Angel of the Lord appeared in a 
dream to Joseph, in Egypt, saying: Arise, and take the 
Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel: for 
they who sought the life of the Child are dead. And he 
arose and took the Child and His mother, and came into the 
land of Israel. But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea, 
in the room of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither: 
and being warned in a dream, retired into the country of 
Galilee. And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, 
that what was said by the prophets might be fulfilled: He 
shall be called a Nazarene. 

THE EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. O God, Who, by means of a star, didst this day 
manifest to the Gentiles Thine only-begotten Son; grant that 
we, to whom Thou hast already made Thyself known by faith; 
may come at last to the vision of the beauty of Thy majesty. 



H2O Gpistles and Gospels. 

EPISTLE. Isaias Ix. 1-6. Arise, be enlightened, 
Jerusalem; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
Lord is risen upon thee. For behold darkness shall cover 
the*earth, and a mist the people; but the Lord shall arise 
upon thee; and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And 
the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and kings in the bright 
ness of thy rising. Lift up thy eyes round about and see; 
all these are gathered together, they are come to thee; 
thy sons shall come from afar and thy daughters shall 
rise up at thy side. Then shalt thou see and abound, 
and thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged, when the 
multitude of the sea shall be converted to thee, the 
strength of the Gentiles shall come to thee. The multi 
tude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Madian 
and Epha; all they from Saba shall come, bringing" gold 
and frankincense, and showing forth praise to the Lord. 

GOSPEL. Matt. ii. 1-12. When Jesus, therefore, was 
born in Bethlehem of Juda, in the days of King Herod, 
behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem, 
saying- Where is He that is born King of the Jews? For 
we have seen His star in the East, and are come to adore 
Him. And King Herod hearing this was troubled, and all 
Jerusalem with him; and assembling together all the 
chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them 
where Christ should be born. But they said to him: 
In Bethlehem of Juda; for so it is written by the prophet: 
And thou Bethlehem, the land of Juda, are not the least 
among the princes of Juda, for out of thee shall come 
forth the captain that shall rule My people Israel. Then 
Herod, privately calling the wise men, learned diligently 
of them the time of the star which appeared to them; 
and sending them into Bethlehem, said: Go and diligently 
inquire after the Child; and when you have found Him, 
bring me word again, that I also may come and adore Him. 
Who having heard the king went their way; and behold, 
the star which they had seen in the East, went before 
them, until it came and stood over where the Child was. 
And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great 
joy. And entering into the house, they found the Child 
with Mary, His Mother, and falling down, they adored 
Him; and opening their treasures, they offered Him gifts, 



Epistles and Gospels. 1121 

gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having received 
an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod, 
they went back another way into their country. 

FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. In Thy loving kindness, O Lord, graciously hear 
the prayer of Thy suppliant people; give unto them at all times 
surely to discern Thy holy will, and strenuously to labor in the 
fulfilling thereof. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xii. 1-5. I beseech you, therefore, 
brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your 
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your 
reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world, 
but be reformed in the newness of your mind that you 
may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the 
perfect will of God. For I say, by the grace that is given 
me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than 
it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety, and 
according as God hath divided to every one the measure of 
faith. For as in one body we have many members, but all 
the members have not the same office : so we being many are 
one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 42-52. When Jesus was twelve 
years old they going up to Jerusalem according to the 
custom of the feast, and having fulfilled the days, when 
they returned, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem, 
and His parents knew it not. And thinking that He was 
in the company, they came a day s journey, and sought 
Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And not 
finding Him, they returned into Jerusalem seeking Him. 
And it came to pass that after three days they found Him 
in the Temple sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing 
them and asking them questions. And all that heard 
Him were astonished at His wisdom and His answers. 
And seeing Him, they wondered. And His Mother said 
to Him: Son, why hast Thou done so to us? Behold Thy 
father and I have sought Thee sorrowing. And He said 
to them: How is it that you sought Me? Did you not 
know that I must be about My Father s business? And 
they understood not the word that He spoke unto them. 
And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, 



1 1 22 Epistles and Gospels. 

and was subject to them. And His Mother kept all these 
words in her heart. And Jesus advanced in wisdom and 
age, and grace with God and men. 

SECOND SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

FEAST OF THE MOST HOLY NAME OF JESUS. 

COLLECT. O God, Who didst appoint Thine only-begotten 
Son to be the Saviour of the world, and didst ordain that He 
should be called Jesus; mercifully grant that we may, in heaven, 
enjoy the blessed vision of Him, to Whose most holy name we 
do reverence upon earth. 

EPISTLE. Acts iv. 8-12. In those days Peter, filled 
with the Holy Ghost, said to them: Ye princes of the 
people and ancients, hear: If we this day are examined 
concerning the good deed done to the infirm man, by what 
means he hath been made whole, be it known to you all, 
and to all the people of Israel: that by the name of Our 
Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Whom you crucified, 
Whom God hath raised from the dead, even by Him this 
man standeth here before you whole. This is the stone 
which was rejected by you the builders; which is become 
the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any 
other. For there is no other name under heaven given 
to men, whereby we must be saved. 

GOSPEL OF THE FEAST. Luke ii. 21. At that time: 
After eight days were accomplished that the Child should 
be circumcised: His name was called JESUS, which was 
called by the angel before He was conceived in the womb. 

Said at the End of Mass. 

COLLECT OF THE SUNDAY. Almighty and eternal God, who 
governest all things in heaven and upon earth; mercifully hear 
the supplications of Thy people, and grant us to pass in Thy 
peace all the days of our life. 

GOSPEL OF THE SUNDAY. John ii. i-u. At that time: 
There was a marriage in Cana of Gaililee, and the Mother 
of Jesus was there. And Jesus was also invited, and His 
disciples, to the marriage. And the wine failing, the Mother 
of Jesus saith to Him: They have no wine. And Jesus 
saith to her: Woman, what is to Me and to thee? My 
hour is not yet come. His Mother saith to the waiters: 



Epistles and Gospels. 1123 

Whatsoever He shall say to you, do ye. Now there were 
set there six water-pots of stone, according to the manner 
of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three 
measures apiece. Jesus saith to them: Fill the water- 
pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now and carry to the 
chief steward of the feast. And they carried it. And 
when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, 
and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who 
had drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the bride 
groom, and saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth 
good wine, and when men have well drank, then that which 
is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now. 
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and 
manifested His glory, and His desciples believed in Him. 

THIRD SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. Almighty and everlasting God, have compassion 
on our weakness, and stretch forth in our defence the right 
hand of Thy majesty. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xii. 16-21. Brethren: Be not wise in 
your own conceits: to no man rendering evil for evil: 
providing good things not only in the sight of God, but 
also in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much 
as in you, having peace with all men. Not revenging 
yourselves, my dearly beloved; but giving place unto 
wrath, for it is written: Revenge to me: I will repav, sa th 
the Lord. But if thine enemy be hungry, give him to ea t; 
if he thirst, give him drink; for doing this thou shalt heap 
coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome by evil, 
but overcome evil by good. 

GOSPEL. Matt. viii. i-ij. At that time: When He 
was come down from the mountains, great multitudes 
followed Him: and behold a leper came and adored Him, 
saying: Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. 
And Jesus, stretching forth His hand, touched him saying: 
I will. Be thou made clean. And forthwith his leprosy 
was cleansed. And Jesus saith to him: See thou tell no 
man : but go show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which 
Moses commanded for a testimony unto them. And when 
He had entered into Capharnaum, there came to Him a 



1 1 24 Epistles and Gospels. 

centurion, beseeching Him, and saying: Lord, my servant 
lieth at home sick of the palsy, and is grievously tormented. 
And Jesus saith to him: I will come and heal him. And 
the centurion, making answer, said: Lord, I am not worthy 
that Thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the 
word, and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a 
man subject to authority, having under me soldiers; and 
I say to this: Go, and he goeth: and to another: Come, 
and he cometh: and to my servant: Do this, and he doth 
it. And Jesus hearing this, marvelled: and said to them 
that followed Him: Amen I say to you, I have not found 
so great faith in Israel. And I say to you that many shall 
come from the East and the West, and shall sit down with 
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: 
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the 
exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth. And Jesus said to the centurion: Go, and as thou 
hast believed, so be it done to thee. And the servant was 
healed at the same hour. 

FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. O God, who knowest that the weakness of man s 
nature availeth not to shield us from the many and great evils 
besetting us; make us whole in body and mind, and be to us 
an ever-present help in the trials our sins have brought upon us. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xiii. 8-10. Brethren: Owe no man 
anything, but to love one another; for he that loveth his 
neighbor hath fulfilled the law. For thou shalt not 
commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not 
steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not 
covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is 
comprised in this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. The love of our neighbor worketh no evil. Love, 
therefore, is the fulfilling of the law. 

GOSPEL. Matt. mil. 23-27. At that time: When He 
entered into the boat, His disciples followed Him: and 
behold a great tempest arose in the sea, so that the boat 
was covered with waves, but He was asleep. And His 
disciples came to Him, and awaked Him, saying: Lord, 
save us, we perish. And Jesus saith to them, Why are you 
fearful, O ye of little faith? Then rising up He commanded 



Epistles and Gospels, 1125 

the winds, and the sea; and there came a great calm. 
But the men wondered, saying, what manner of Man is 
this, for the winds and the sea obey Him? 

FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. Do Thou, O Lord, in Thy goodness, unceasingly 
watch over Thine household; so that Thy servants, putting 
all their trust in the hope of Thy heavenly favor, may live assured 
of Thy protection. Others for Church or Pope as on p. mi. 

EPISTLE. Col. Hi. 12-17. Brethren: Put ye on there 
fore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, the bowels of 
mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience: bearing 
with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have 
a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath for 
given you, so you also. But above all these things have 
charity, which is the bond of perfection : and let the peace 
of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called 
in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ 
dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom, teaching and admon 
ishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, 
singing in grace in your hearts to God. All whatsoever 
you do in word or in work, all things do ye in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father 
by Him. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xiii. 24-30. At that time Jesus spoke 
this parable to the multitude, saying: The kingdom of 
heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seed in his 
field: but while men were asleep, his enemy came and 
oversowed cockle among the wheat, and went his way. 
And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought 
forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle. And the ser 
vants of the good man of the house coming said to him: 
Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence 
then hath it cockle? and he said to them: An enemy hath 
done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that 
we go and gather it up? And he said: No; lest perhaps 
gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together 
with it. Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the 
time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: Gather up 
first the cockle, and bind it in bundles to burn; but the 
wheat gather ye into my barn.

SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER EPIPHANY. 

COLLECT. Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty God, that, 
striving always to act according to right reason, we may come, 
in every word and in every deed, to fulfil Thy holy will. 

EPISTLE. I Thcss. i. 2-10. Brethren: We give thanks 
to God always for you all: making a remembrance of 
you in our prayers without ceasing, being mindful of the 
work of your faith, and labor, and charity, and of the 
enduring of the hope of Our Lord Jesus Christ before God 
and our Father. Knowing, brethren beloved of God, 
your election: for our gospel hath not been unto you in 
word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and 
in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have 
been among you for your sakes. And you became fol 
lowers of us, and of the Lord, receiving the word in much 
tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost: so that you were 
made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in 
Achaia. For from you was spread abroad the word of 
the Lord, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also 
in every place, your faith which is towards God, is gone 
forth, so that we need not to speak anything. For they 
themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had 
unto you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve 
the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from 
heaven (Whom He raised up from the dead), Jesus Who 
hath delivered us from the wrath to come. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xiii. 31-35. At that time Jesus spoke 
to the multitude this parable: The kingdom of heaven 
is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and 
sowed in his field: which is the least indeed of all seeds: 
but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and 
becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and dwell 
in the branches thereof. Another parable He spoke to 
them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a 
woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the 
whole was leavened. All these things Jesus spoke in 
parables to the multitudes: and without parables He 
did not speak to them. That it might be fulfilled which 
was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open My mouth 
in parables, I will utter things hidden from the founda 
tion of the world. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1127 

SEPTUAGESIMA SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. Graciously hear, O Lord, the prayers of Thy faith 
ful people, who, chastened by Thy justice on account of their 
sins, to the glory of Thy name trust in Thy mercy for deliver 
ance. 

EPISTLE, i Cor. ix. 24-27; x. 1-5. Brethren: Know 
you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, 
but one receiveth the prize? So run that you may obtain. 
And every one that striveth for the mastery refraineth 
himself from all things, and they indeed that they may 
receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible one. 
I therefore so run, not as an uncertainty: I so fight, not 
as one beating the air: but I chastise my body, and bring 
it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to 
others, I myself should become a cast-away. For I would 
not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were 
all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and 
all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea: 
and did all eat the same spiritual food, and all drank the 
same spiritual drink (and they drank of the spiritual rock 
that followed them: and the rock was Christ) but with the 
most of them God was not well pleased. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xx. 1-16. At this time Jesus said to 
His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven is like 
to an householder, who went out early in the morning to 
hire laborers into his vineyard. And having agreed with 
the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vine 
yard. And going out about the third hour, he saw others 
standing in the market-place idle, and he said to them: 
Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what 
shall be just. And they went their way. And again he 
went out about the sixth and ninth hour: and did in like 
manner. But about the eleventh hour he went out and 
found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand 
you here all the day idle? They say unto him: Because no 
man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into 
my vineyard. And when evening was come, the lord of 
the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the laborers and 
pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the

eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But 
when the first also came, they thought that they should 
receive more; and they also received every man a penny. 
And receiving it they murmured against the master of the 
house, saying: These last have worked but one hour, and 
thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the 
burden of the day and the heats. But he answering said to 
one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not 
agree with me for a penny? Take what is thine, and go 
thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee. Or, 
is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil 
because I am good? So shall the last be first, and the first 
last; for many are called, but few chosen. 

SEXAGESIMA SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. O God, Who seest that we put no trust in ourselves, 
vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, that the patronage of the Doctor 
of the Gentiles may be our safeguard from all evil. 

EPISTLE. 2 Cor. xi. 19-33; xii. I-Q. Brethren: You 
gladly suffer the foolish: whereas yourselves are wise. 
For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man 
devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, 
if a man strike you on the face. I speak according to 
dishonor, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein 
if any man dare (I speak foolishly) I dare also: they are 
Hebrews, so am I: they are Israelites, so am I: they are 
the seed of Abraham, so am I: they are the ministers of 
Christ (I speak as one less wise) , I am more : in many more 
labors, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, 
in deaths often. Of the Jews five times did I receive forty 
stripes, save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I 
was stoned., thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day 
I was in the depth of the sea. In journeying often, in 
perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own 
nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in 
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from 
false brethren: in labor and painfulness, in much watch- 
ings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and 
nakedness. Besides those things which are without: 
my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1129 

Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and 
I am not on fire? If I must needs glory, I will glory of the 
things that concern my infirmity. The God and Father 
of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is blessed forever, knoweth 
that I lie not. At Damascus, the governor of the nation 
under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes 
to apprehend me: .and through a window in a basket 
was I let down by the wall, and so escaped his hands. If I 
must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to 
the visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in 
Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, 
I know not, or out of the body, I know not, God knoweth) 
such an one rapt even to the third heaven. And I know 
such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I 
cannot tell: God knoweth) that he was caught up into 
paradise: and heard secret words which it is not granted 
to man to utter. For such an one I will glory: but for 
myself I will glory nothing, in my infirmities. For though 
I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish : for 
I will say the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should 
think of me above that which he seeth in me, or anything 
he heareth from me. And lest the greatness of the revela 
tions should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my 
flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me. For which thing 
thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me: 
and He said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for 
power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will 
I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may 
dwell in me. 

GOSPEL. Luke mii. 4-15. At that time: When a very 
great multitude was gathered together and hastened out 
of the cities unto Him, He spoke by a similitude: The 
sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed some 
fell by the wayside and it was trodden down, and the fowls 
of the air devoured it. And other some fell upon a rock: 
and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because 
it had no moisture. And other some fell among thorns, 
and the thorns growing up with it, choked it. And other 
some fell upon good ground: and being sprung up, 
yielded fruit a hundred fold. Saying these things, He 
cried out: He that hath ears to hear let him hear. And 



1 130 Epistles and Gospels. 

His disciples asked Him what this parable might be. To 
whom He said: To you it is given to know the mystery 
of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, that 
seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand. 
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 
And they by the wayside are they that hear: then the 
devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest 
believing they should be saved. Now they upon the rock, 
are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy: 
and these have no roots: for they believe for a while, and 
in time of temptation, they fall away. And that which 
fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going 
their way. are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures 
of this life, and yield no fruit. But that on the good 
ground, are they who in a good and very good heart, 
hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience. 

QUINQUAGESIMA SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. Mercifully hear our prayers, we beseech Thee, 
O Lord; free us from the chains of sin, and deliver us from all 
evil. Others as on p. 1111. 

EPISTLE, i Cor. xiii. 1-13. Brethren: If I speak 
with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not 
charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal ; 
and if I should have prophecy, and should know all mys 
teries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so 
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I 
am nothing. And if I should distribute all my goods to 
feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, 
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity is 
patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not per 
versely, is not puffed up, is not ambitious, seeketh not her 
own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth 
not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth: beareth 
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth 
all things. Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies 
shall be made void or tongues shall cease, or knowledge 
shall be destroyed. For we know in part, and we prophesy 
in part. But when that which is perfect is come, that 
which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child 






Epistles and Gospels. 1131 

I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a 
child. But when I became a man I put away the things 
of a child. We see now through a glass in a dark manner: 
but then face to face. Now I know in part: but then I 
shall know even as I am known. And now there remain, 
Faith, Hope, Charity: these three; but the greater of 
these is charity. 

GOSPEL. Luke xviii. 31-43. At that time: Jesus 
took unto Him the twelve, and said to them: Behold we 
go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished 
which were written by the prophets concerning the Son 
of man; for He shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall 
be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon: and after they have 
scourged Him they will put Him to death, and the third 
day He shall rise again. And they understood none of 
these things, and this word was hid from them, and they 
understood not the things that were said. Now it came to 
pass when He drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind 
man sat by the wayside, begging. And when he heard 
the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant. And 
they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 
And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy 
on me. And thay that went before, rebuked him, that he 
should hold his peace. But he cried out much more: 
Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus standing 
commanded him to be brought unto Him. And when he 
was come near, He asked him, saying: What wilt thou 
that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see. 
And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath 
made thee whole. And immediately he saw, and followed 
Him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw 
it, gave praise to God. 

ASH WEDNESDAY. 

COLLECT. I. Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, that Thy faith 
ful people may, with seemly devotion, enter upon this solemn 
season of fasting, and in austere discipline piously persevere 
to the end thereof. 

II. Save us, we beseech Thee, O Lord, from all dangers to 
soul or body: and, moved by the prayers of the blessed and 
glorious Mary, ever a virgin, mother of God, of Saint Joseph, 
of Thy holy apostles Peter and Paul, of blessed N., {here is named

the patron saint) and of all Thy saints, in Thy goodness ensure 
to us safety and peace. Do Thou bring to naught all the assaults 
of the enemies of Thy Church, make to cease all false teaching, 
and enable her to serve Thee in freedom and in safety. 

III. Almighty and everlasting God, Who rulest alike over 
the living and the dead, and Who showest mercy to every one, 
whom Thou foreknowest will, by faith and good works, one day 
be Thine: most humbly, we beseech Thee, that every one, on 
whose behalf we have purposed to put up our prayers to Thee, 
whether this world still detain him in the flesh, or already his 
soul have passed out of the body into that which is to come, 
may, all Thy saints interceding for him, out of the abundance 
of Thy mercies, obtain the remission for all his sins. 

EPISTLE. Joel ii. 12-19. Therefore saith the Lord: 
Be converted to Me with all your heart, in fasting, and in 
weeping, and in mourning. And rend your hearts and not 
your garments, and turn to the Lord your God : for He is 
gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready 
to repent of the evil. Who knoweth but He will return, 
and forgive, and leave a blessing behind Him, sacrifice 
and libation to the Lord your God? Blow the trumpet 
in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather 
together the people, sanctify the Church, assemble the 
ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck 
at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, 
and the bride out of her bride-chamber. Between the 
porch and the altar the priests, the Lord s ministers, shall 
weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare Thy people; 
and give not Thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathens 
should rule over them; why should they say among the 
nations: Where is their God? The Lord hath been zealous 
for His land, and hath spared His people: and the Lord 
answered and said to His people: Behold I will send you 
corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: 
and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. 

GOSPEL. Matt. vi. 16-21. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: When you fast, be not as the hypocrites, 
sad: for they disfigure their faces that they may appear 
unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received 
their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy 
head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not to men to 
fast, but to thy Father Who is in secret: and thy Father, 
Who seeth in secret, will repay thee. Lay not up to your-

selves treasures on earth: where the rust and moth con 
sume, and where thieves break through and steal. But 
lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither 
the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do 
not break through, nor steal. For where thy treasure 
is, there is thy heart also. 

FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT. 

COLLECT. O God, Who year by year dost purify Thy Church 
with Lenten discipline; grant that Thy faithful people, while 
striving by self-denial to deserve Thy favor, may further assure 
themselves thereof by abounding in good works. 

EPISTLE. 2 Cor. m. i-io. Brethren: We helping 
do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in 
vain: For He saith: In an accepted time have I heard 
thee, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Be 
hold now is the acceptable time: behold now is the day of 
salvation; giving no offence to any man, that our ministry 
be not blamed; but in all things let us exhibit ourselves 
as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, 
in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in prisons, in seditions, 
in labors, in watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, 
in long-suffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity 
unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the "power of God, by 
the armor of justice on the right hand and on the left, by 
honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as 
deceivers, and yet true: as unknown, and yet known: as 
dying, and behold we live: as chastised, and not killed: 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing: as needy, yet enriching 
many: as having nothing, and possessing all things. 

GOSPEL. Matt. iv. i-n. At that time: Jesus was led 
by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil. 
And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, after 
wards He was hungry. And the tempter coming, said to 
Him: If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones 
be made bread. Who answered and said: It is written : Not in 
bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth 
from the mouth of God. Then the devil took Him up into 
the holy city, and set Him upon a pinnacle of the Temple, 
and said to Him: If Thou be the Son of God, cast Thyself 



1 134 Epistles and Gospels. 

down: for it is written: that He hath given His angels 
charge over Thee, and in their hands shall they bear Thee 
up, lest perhaps Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. 
Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not 
tempt the Lord thy God. Again the devil took Him up 
into a very high mountain: and showed Him all the king 
doms of the world, and the glory of them, and said to Him; 
All these will I give Thee, if falling down Thou wilt adore 
me. Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan: for it is 
written: The Lord thy God shalt thou adore: and Him 
only shalt thou serve. Then the devil left Him, and behold 
angels came and ministered to Him. 

SECOND SUNDAY OF LENT. 

COLLECT. O God, Who seest that we of ourselves avail not 
at all; inwardly and outwardly hold us in Thy holy keeping, 
that we may neither be overcome in body by adversity, nor in 
mind be a prey to evil thoughts. 

Others as on Ash Wednesday, p. 1131. 

EPISTLE. / Thess. iv. 1-7. Brethren: We pray and 
beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received 
of us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also 
you would walk that you may abound the more. For 
you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord 
Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: 
that you should abstain from fornication, that every one 
of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctifica 
tion and honor: not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles 
that know not God: and that no man overreach, nor 
circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is 
the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, 
and have testified: for God hath not called us unto un- 
cleanness, but unto sanctification. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xvii. 1-9. At that time: Jesus taketh 
unto Him Peter, and James and John his brother, and 
bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: and He was 
transfigured before them. And His face did shine as the 
sun : and His garments became white as snow. And behold 
there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with Him. 
And Peter, answering, said to Jesus: Lord, It is good for 



Epistles and Gospels. 1135 

us to be here: if Thou wilt, let us make here three taber 
nacles, one for Thee and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 
And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud over- 
shaded them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: 
This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased : hear 
ye Him. And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face: 
and were very much afraid. And Jesus came and touched 
them: and said to them: Arise, and fear not. And they 
lifting up their eyes saw no one, but only Jesus. And as 
they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them 
saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be 
risen from the dead. 

THIRD SUNDAY OF LENT. 

COLLECT. Humbling ourselves before Thee, we beseech Thee, 
almighty God, favorably to regard the desires of our heart: 
and in our defence to stretch forth the right hand of Thy 
majesty. Others as on Ash Wednesday, p. 1131. 

EPISTLE. Eph. v. I-Q. Brethren: Be ye therefore, 
followers of God, as most dear children: and walk in love 
as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered Himself 
for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odor of 
sweetness. But fornication and all uncleanness, or covet - 
ousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as 
becometh saints: or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scur 
rility, which is to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks. 
For know ye this, and understand that no fornification, 
or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), 
hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of 
these things cometh the anger of God upon the children 
of unbelief. Be ye not therefore partakers with them. 
For you were heretofore darkness: but now light in the 
Lord. Walk then as children of the light: for the fruit 
of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth. 

GOSPEL. Luke xi. 14-28. At that time: He was 
casting out a devil, and the same was dumb. And when 
He had cast out the devil, the dumb spoke; and the 
multitudes were in admiration at it: but some of them 
said: He casteth out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of 



1136 Epistles and Gospels. 

devils. And others, tempting, asked of Him a sign from 
heaven. But He, seeing their thoughts, said to them: 
Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to 
desolation, and house upon house shall fall. And if Satan 
also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom 
stand? because you say, that through Beelzebub I cast 
out devils. Now if I cast out devils through Beelzebub: 
by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore 
they shall be your judges. But if I, by the finger of God, 
cast out devils: doubtless the kingdom of God is come 
upon you. When a strong man armed keepeth his court: 
those things are in peace which he possesseth. But if a 
stronger than he come upon him and overcome him: he 
will take away all his armor wherein he trusted, and will 
distribute his spoils. He that is not with Me is against 
Me: and he that gathereth not with Me, scattereth. When 
the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through 
places without water, seeking rest, and not finding, he 
saith: I will return into my house whence I came out. 
And when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished. 
Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more 
wicked than himself, and entering in they dwell there. 
And the last state of that man becomes worse than the 
first. And it came to pass as He spoke these things a cer 
tain woman from the crowd lifting up her voice said to 
Him: Blessed is the womb that bore Thee and the paps 
that gave Thee suck. But He said: Yea, rather blessed 
are they who hear the word of God and keep it. 

FOURTH SUNDAY OF LENT. 

COLLECT. Grant, we beseech Thee, almighty God, that chas 
tened by suffering, as because of our transgressions was mete, 
we may inwardly be gladdened by Thy comforting grace. Others 
as on Ash Wednesday, p. 1131. 

EPISTLE. Gal. iv. 22-31. Brethren: It is written 
that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, 
and the other by a freewoman: but he who was of the 
bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he of 
the freewoman was by promise: which things are said 
by an allegory: for these are the two testaments. The 



Epistles and Gospels. 1137 

one from Mount Sina engendering unto bondage: which 
is Agar: for Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath 
affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage 
with her children. But that Jerusalem which is above, is 
free, which is our mother. For it is written: Rejoice thou 
barren that beareth not: break forth and cry, thou that 
travailest not; for many are the children of the desolate, 
more than of her that hath a husband. Now we, brethren, 
as Isaac was, are the children of promise. But as then he, 
that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that 
was after the spirit: so also it is now. But what saith 
the Scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for 
the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son 
of the freewoman. So, then, brethren, we are not the 
children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom 
wherewith Christ hath made us free. 

GOSPEL. John vi. 1-15. At that time : Jesus went over 
the sea of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias: and a great 
multitude followed Him, because they saw the miracles 
which He did on them that were diseased. Jesus therefore 
went up into a mountain: and there He sat with His 
disciples. Now the Pasch, the festival day of the Jews, 
was near at hand. When Jesus therefore had lifted up 
His eyes, and seen that a very great multitude cometh to 
Him, He said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that 
these may eat? And this He said to try him, for He Himself 
knew what He would do. Philip answered Him: Two 
hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, 
that every one may take a little. One of His disciples, 
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to Him: There 
is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: 
but what are these among so many? Then Jesus said: 
make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in 
the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about 
five .thousand. And Jesus took the loaves: and when He 
had given thanks, He distributed to them that were sat 
down: in like manner also of the fishes as much as they 
would. And when they were filled, He said to His disciples : 
Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost. 
They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets 
with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which re- 



1138 Epistles and Gospels. 

mained over and above to them that had eaten. Now 
those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had 
done, said: This is of a truth the prophet that is to come 
into the world. Jesus therefore, when He knew that they 
would come to take Him by force and make Him king, 
fled again into the mountain Himself alone. 

PASSION SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. I. Look down in mercy, we beseech Thee, O Lord, 
upon Thy family; by Thy governance may we be outwardly 
protected in body; by Thy favor may we be inwardly strength 
ened in heart and mind. 

II. O God, the shepherd (as on p. 1111). 

EPISTLE. Hcb. ix. 11-15. Brethren: Christ being 
come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater 
and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, 
not of this creation: neither by the blood of goats, nor of 
calves, but by His own blood, entered once into the holies, 
having obtained eternal redemption. For if the blood of 
goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, 
sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh: 
how much more shall the blood of Christ, Who by the Holy 
Ghost offered Himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our 
conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? 
And therefore He is the mediator of the New Testament: 
that by means of His death, for the redemption of those 
transgressions, which were under the former testament, 
they that are called may receive the promise of eternal 
inheritance. 

GOSPEL. John viii. 46-59. At that time Jesus said 
to the multitude of the Jews: Which of you shall convince 
Me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not 
believe Me? He that is of God, heareth the words of God. 
Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God. 
The Jews therefore answered and said to Him: Do not 
we say well that Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
Jesus answered: I have not a devil, but I honor My Father, 
and you have dishonored Me. But I seek not My own 
glory: there is One that seeketh and judgeth. Amen, 
amen I say to you: If any man keep My word, he shall 



Epistles and Gospels. IJ 39 

not see death for ever. The Jews therefore said: Now we 
know that Thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the 
prophets: and Thou sayest: If any man keep My word 
he shall not taste death for ever. Art Thou greater than 
our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are 
dead. Whom dost Thou make Thyself? Jesus answered: 
If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father 
that glorifieth Me, of Whom you say that He is your God, 
and you have not known Him: but I know Him: and if I 
shall say that I know Him not, I shall be like to you, a 
liar. But I do know Him, and do keep His word. Abra 
ham your father rejoiced that he might see My day: he 
saw it, and was glad. The Jews therefore said to Him: 
Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abra 
ham? Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, 
before Abraham was made, I am. They took up stones 
therefore to cast at Him: but Jesus hid Himself and went 
out of the Temple.

PALM SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. O almighty and everlasting God, Who, setting up 
an example of humility for all mankind to follow, didst will 
that our Saviour should take upon Him our nature, and should 
suffer the death of the cross: enable us, we beseech Thee, ever 
to bear in mind the teachings of His patience, and in fine to 
deserve to have part in His resurrection. 

EPISTLE. Phil. ii. 5-11. Brethren: Let this mind 
be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who being in 
the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with 
God: but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, 
being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a 
man. He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto 
death, even to the death of the cross. For which cause 
God also hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a name 
which is above all names: that in the name of Jesus every 
knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, 
and under the earth. And that every tongue should con 
fess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the 
Father. 



1 140 Epistles and Gospels. 

GOSPEL. The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ according 
to Matt. xxvi. and xxvii. At that time: Jesus said to 
to His disciples: You know that after two days shall be 
the Pasch, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to be 
crucified. Then were gathered together the chief priests 
and ancients of the people into the court of the high-priest, 
who was called Caiphas: and they consulted together, 
that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus and put 
Him to death. But they said: Not on the festival-day, 
lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people. 
And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon 
the leper, there came to Him a woman having an alabaster 
box of precious ointment, and poured it on His head as 
He was at table. And the disciples seeing it, had indigna 
tion, saying: To what purpose is this waste? for this 
might have been sold for much and given to the poor. And 
Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this 
woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon Me. 
For the poor you have always with you: but Me you have 
not always. For she, in pouring this ointment upon My 
body, hath done it for My burial. Amen I say to you, 
wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, 
that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory 
of her. Then went one of the twelve, who was called 
Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests. And said to them: 
What will you give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? 
But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver. And 
from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray Him. 
And on the first day of the Azymes the disciples came to 
Jesus, saying: Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee 
to eat the Pasch? But Jesus said: Go ye into the city 
to a certain man, and say to him: The Master saith: My 
time is near at hand, with thee I make the Pasch with 
My disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus appointed 
to them, and they prepared the Pasch. But when it was 
evening, He sat down with His twelve disciples. And 
whilst they were eating, He said: Amen I say to you, 
that one of you is about to betray Me. And they being 
very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord? 
But He answering, said: He that dippeth his hand witl 
Me in the dish, he shall betray Me. The Son of man 




Epistles and Gospels. 

indeed goeth, as it is written of Him: but wo to th 
by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed : it we^T b 
for him if that man had not been born And Ju^as tha 
betrayed Him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? HeSafll 
to him: Thou has said it. And whilst they were at supper, 
Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to 
His disciples, and said : Take ye, and eat : this is My body. 
And taking the chalice He gave thanks: and gave to them, 
saying: Drink ye all of this. For this is My blood of the 
New Testament, which shall be shed for many unto remis 
sion of sins. And I say to you I will not drink from hence 
forth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall 
drink it with you new in the kingdom of My leather. And 
a hymn being said, they went out unto Mount Olivet. 
Then Jesus saith to them: All you shall be scandalized 
in Me this night. For it is written: I will strike the 
shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed. But 
after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 
And Peter answering, said to Him: Although all shall be 
scandalized in Thee, I will never be scandalized. Jesus 
said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before 
the cock crow, thou wilt deny Me thrice. Peter saith to 
Him: Yea, though I should die with Thee, I will not deny 
Thee. And in like manner said all the disciples. Then 
Jesus came with them into a country place which is called 
Gethsemani, and He said to His disciples: Sit you here, 
till I go yonder and pray. And taking with Him Peter and 
the two sons of Zebedee, He began to grow sorrowful and 
to be sad. Then He saith to them: My soul is sorrowful 
even unto death: stay you here and watch with Me. And 
going a little further, He fell upon His face, praying and 
saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass 
from Me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt. 
And He cometh to His disciples and findeth them asleep, 
and He saith to Peter: What! could you not watch one 
hour with Me? Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into 
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh 
weak. Again the second time He went and prayed, say 
ing: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but 
I must drink it, Thy will be done. And He cometh again, 
and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy. 



1 142 Epistles and Gospels. 

And leaving them, He went again: and He prayed the 
third time, saying the self-same word. Then He cometh 
to His disciples and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take 
your rest: behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man 
shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us 
go: behold he is at hand that will betray Me. As He yet 
spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with 
him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the 
chief priests and the ancients of the people. And he that 
betrayed Him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever 
I shall kiss, that is He, hold Him fast. And forthwith 
coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed 
Him. And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou 
come? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus, and 
held Him. And behold one of them that were with Jesus, 
stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword, and striking 
the servant of the high-priest, cut off his ear. Then Jesus 
saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: For 
all that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Think- 
est thou that I cannot ask My Father, and He will give 
Me presently more than twelve legions of angels? How 
then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done? 
In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are 
come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to 
apprehend Me. I sat daily with you teaching in the Temple, 
and you laid not hands on Me. Now all this was done, 
that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. 
Then the disciples all leaving Him, fled. But they holding 
Jesus led Him to Caiphas, the high-priest, where the scribes 
and the ancients were assembled. And Peter followed 
Him afar off, even to the court of the high -priest. And 
going in he sat with the servants, that he might see the 
end. And the chief priests and the whole council sought 
false witness against Jesus that they might put Him to 
death: and they found not, whereas many false witnesses 
had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses, 
and they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the 
Temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it. And 
the high-priest rising up, said to Him: Answereth Thou 
nothing to the things which these witness against Thee? 
But Jesus held His peace. And the high-priest said to 



Epistles and Gospels. 1143 

Him: I adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou tell 
us if Thou be the Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith to 
him: Thou hast said it; nevertheless I say to you, here 
after you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand 
of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
Then the high-priest rent his garments, saying: He hath 
blasphemed: what further need have we of witnesses? 
Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy; what think 
you? But they answering, said, He is guilty of death. 
Then did they spit in His face, and buffeted Him, and others 
struck His face with the palms of their hands, saying : Proph 
esy unto us, O Christ; who is he that struck Thee? But 
Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him 
a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the 
Galilean. 

But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what 
tHou sayest. And as he went out of the gate another 
mard saw him, and she saith to them that were there: 
This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. And again 
he denied with an oath: That I know not the man. And 
after a little while they came that stood by, and said to 
Peter: Surely thou also art one of them: for even thy speech 
doth discover thee. Then he began to curse and to swear 
that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock 
crew. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which 
He had said: Before the cock crow thou wilt deny Me 
thrice. And going forth he wept bitterly. And when 
morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the 
people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put 
Him to death. And they brought Him bound and delivered 
Him to Pontius Pilate the governor. Then Judas who 
betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, repenting 
himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the 
chief priests and ancients, saying: I have sinned in betray 
ing innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? 
Look thou to it. And casting down the pieces of silver 
in the Temple he departed: and went and hanged himself 
with an halter. But the chief priests having taken the 
pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the 
corbona, because it is the price of blood. And after they 
had consulted together, they bought with them the potter s 



H44 Epistles and Gospels. 

field to be a burying-place for strangers. For this cause 
that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, 
even to this day. Then was fulfilled that which _ was 
spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took 
the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was prized. 
Whom they prized of the children of Israel: and they gave 
them unto the potter s field, as the Lord appointed to me. 
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor 
asked|Him, saying: Art Thou the King of the Jews? Jesus 
saith to him: Thou sayest it. And when He was accused 
by the chief priests and ancients, He answered nothing. 
Then Pilate saith to Him: Dost not Thou hear how great 
testimonies they allege against Thee? And He answered 
him to never a word: so that the governor wondered 
exceedingly. Now upon the solemn day the governor 
was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, 
whom they would; and he had then a notorious prisoner 
that was called Barabbas. They therefore being gathered 
together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, 
Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ? For he knew that 
for envy they had delivered Him. And as he was sitting 
in the place of judgment his wife sent to him saying: Have 
thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered 
many things this day in a dream because of Him. But the 
chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that they 
should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away. And the 
governor answering said to them: Whether will you of 
the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas. 
Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that 
is called Christ? They say all: Let Him be crucified. 
The governor said to them: \Vhy, what evil hath He 
done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let Him be 
crucified. And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, 
but that rather a tumult was made: taking water, washed, 
his hands before the people saying: I am innocent of the 
blood of this just man; look you to it. And the whole 
people answering, said: His blood be upon us and upon 
our children. Then he released to them Barabbas: and 
having scourged Jesus, delivered Him unto them to be 
crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus 
into the hall, gathered together unto Him the whole band; 



Epistles and Gospels. 1145 

and stripping Him, they put a scarlet cloak about Him. 
And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, 
and a reed in His right hand. And bowing the knee 
before Him, they mocked Him, saying: Hail, King of the 
Jews! And spitting upon Him, they took the reed, and 
struck His head. And after they had mocked Him, they 
took off the cloak from Him and put on Him His own 
garments, and led Him away to crucify Him. And going 
out they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they 
forced to take up His cross. And they came to the place 
that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. 
And they gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall. And 
when He had tasted, He would not drink. And after they 
had crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting 
lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the 
prophet, saying: They divided My garments among them, 
and upon My vesture they cast lots. And they sat and 
watched Him. And they put over His head His cause, 
written: THIS is JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then 
were crucified with Him two thieves: one on the right 
hand, and one on the left. And they that passed by blas 
phemed Him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, 
Thou that destroyest the Temple of God, and in three days 
dost rebuild it: save Thy own self: if Thou be the Son of 
God, come down from the cross. In like manner also the 
chief priests with the scribes and ancients mocking, said: 
He saved others, Himself He cannot save: if He be the 
King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, 
and we will believe Him. He trusted in God: let Him 
now deliver Him if He will have Him: for He said: I am 
the Son of God. And the self-same thing the thieves 
also, that were crucified with Him, reproached Him with. 
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the 
whole earth, until the ninth hour.- And about the ninth 
hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma 
sabacthani? that is, My God, My God, why hast Thou 
forsaken Me? And some that stood there and heard, said : 
This man calleth Elias. And immediately one of them 
running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and 
put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink. And the others 
said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver 



1146 Epistles and Gospels. 

Him. And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded 
up the ghost. And behold the veil of the Temple was 
rent in two from the top even to the bottom; and the 
earth quaked, and the rocks were rent. And the graves 
were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept, 
arose, and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, 
came into the holy city, and appeared unto many. Now 
the centurion, and they that were with him watching 
Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that 
were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the 
Son of God. And there were many women afar off, who 
had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto Him: 
among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother 
of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. 
And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man 
of Arimathea, named Joseph; who also himself was a 
disciple of Jesus; he went to Pilate and asked the body 
of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be 
delivered. And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up 
in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new monu 
ment, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled 
a great stone to the door of the monument and went his 
way.- And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the 
other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre. And the 
next day, which followed the day of preparation, the 
chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, 
saying: Sir, we have remembered that that seducer said 
while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. 
Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the 
third day: lest perhaps His disciples come and steal 
Him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the 
dead: and the last error shall be worse than the first. 
Pilate said to them: You have a guard: go guard it as 
you know. And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, 
sealing the stone, and setting guards. 

MAUNDY THURSDAY. 

EPISTLE, i Cor. xi. 20-32. Brethren: When you 
come together into one place, it is not now to eat the 
Lord s Supper. For every one taketh before his own 



Epistles and Gospels, 1147 

supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry: and another is 
drunk. What, have you not houses to eat and to drink 
in? Or despise ye the Church of God, and put. them to 
shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I 
praise you? In this I praise you not. For I have received 
of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that 
the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, 
took bread, and giving thanks, broke and said: Take ye 
and eat: This is My body, which shall be delivered for you: 
this do for the commemoration of Me. In like manner 
also the chalice, after He had supped, saying: This chalice 
is the new testament in My blood, this do ye as often as 
you shall drink, for the commemoration of Me. For as 
often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, 
you shall show the death of the Lord until He come. 
Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the 
chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body 
and blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself: and 
so let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. For 
he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and 
drinketh judgment to himself: not discerning the body 
of the Lord. Therefore are there many infirm and weak 
among you, and many sleep. But if we would judge 
ourselves, we should not be judged. But whilst we are 
judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not 
condemned with this world. 

GOSPEL. John xiii. 1-15. Before the festival day of 
the Pasch, Jesus knowing that His hour was come, that 
He should pass out of this world to the Father: having 
loved His own who were in the world, He loved them unto 
the end. And when supper was done, the devil having 
now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, 
to betray Him: knowing that the Father had given Him 
all things into His hands, and that He came from God, 
and goeth to God: He riseth from supper, and layeth 
aside His garments: and having taken a towel, girded Him 
self. After that He putteth water into a basin, and began 
to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with 
the towel wherewith He was girded. He cometh therefore 
to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him: Lord, dost 
Thou wash my feet? Jesus answereth, and said to him: 



1148 Epistles and Gospels. 

\\ hat I do thou knowest not now, but shalt know hereafter. 
Peter said to Him. Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus 
answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no 
part with Me. Simon Peter said to Him: Lord, not only 
my feet, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith 
to him. He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his 
feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all. 
For He knew who he was that would betray Him: therefore 
He said: You are not all clean. Then after He had washed 
their feet, and taken His garments, being sat down again, 
He said to them: Know you what I have done to you? 
You call Me Master and Lord: and you say well, for so I 
am. If then I, being your Lord and Master, have washed 
your feet: you also ought to wash one another s feet. 
For I have given you an example, that as I have done to 
you, so you do also. 

GOOD FRIDAY. 

THE FIRST LESSON. Osee m. 1-6. Thus saith the Lord: 
In their affliction they will rise early to Me. Come 
and let us return to the Lord: for He hath taken us, and 
He will heal us: He will strike, and He will cure us. He 
will revive us after two days: on the third day He will 
raise us up, and we shall live in His sight. We shall know, 
and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord. His 
going forth is prepared as the morning light, and He will 
come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth. 
What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? W r hat shall I do to 
thee, Juda? Your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as 
the dew that goeth away in the morning. For this reason 
have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by 
the words of My mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth 
as the light. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and 
the knowledge of God more than holocausts. 

THE SECOND LESSON. Exod. xii. i-n. In those days 
the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt: 
This month shall be to you the beginning of months: 
it shall be the first in the months of the year. Speak ye 
to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to 
them: On the tenth day of this month let every man take 



Epistles and Gospels. 1149 

a lamb by their families and houses. But if the number 
be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto 
him his neighbor that joineth to his house, according to 
the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb. 
And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male of one year; 
according to which rite also you shall take a kid. And 
you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; 
and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall 
sacrifice it in the evening; and they shall take of the blood 
thereof, and put it upon both the side-posts and on the 
upper doorposts of the houses wherein they shall eat it. 
And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire, 
and unleavened bread with wild lettuce. You shall not 
eat thereof anything raw, nor boiled in water, but only 
roasted at the fire: you shall eat the head with the feet and 
entrails thereof. Neither shall there remain anything 
of it till morning. If there be anything left, you shall 
burn it with fire. And thus you shall eat it; you shall 
gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet: 
holding staves in your hands; and you shall eat in haste. 
For it is the Phase (that is, the passage) of the Lord. 

GOSPEL. John xviii. and xix. At that time: Jesus 
went forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, 
where there was a garden, into which He entered with 
His disciples. And Judas also, who betrayed Him, knew 
the place, because Jesus had often resorted thither together 
with His disciples. Judas therefore having received a 
band of soldiers, and servants from the chief priests and 
the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and 
weapons. Jesus therefore knowing all things that should 
come upon Him, went forth, and said to them: Whom 
seek ye? They answered Him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus 
saith to them: I am He. And Judas also who betrayed 
Him, stood with them. As soon therefore as He had said 
to them: I am He: they went backward, and fell to the 
ground. Again therefore He asked them: Whom seek ye? 
And they said: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I 
have told you that I am He. If therefore you seek Me, 
let these go their way. That the word might be fulfilled, 
which He said: Of .them whom Thou hast given Me, I 
have not lost any one. Then Simon Peter having a sword, 



1150 Epistles and Gospels. 

drew it, and struck the servant of the high-priest, and 
cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was 
Malchus. Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy 
sword into the scabbard. The chalice which My Father 
hath given Me, shall I not drink it? Then the band and the 
tribune, and the servants of the Jews took Jesus and bound 
Him: and they led Him away to Annas first, for he was 
father-in-law to Caiphas, who was the high-priest of that 
year. Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel 
to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die 
for the people. And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so 
did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the 
high-priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the 
high-priest. But Peter stood at the door without. The 
other disciple, therefore, who was known to the high- 
priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought 
in Peter. The maid therefore that was portress, saith to 
Peter: Art not thou also one of this man s disciples? He 
saith: I am not. Now the servants and ministers stood 
at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed them 
selves. And with them was Peter also standing, and warm 
ing himself. The high-priest therefore asked Jesus of 
His disciples, and of His doctrine. Jesus answered him: 
I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in 
the synagogue and in the Temple, whither all the Jews 
resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing. Why asketh 
thou Me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken 
unto them: behold they know what things I have said. 
And when He had said these things, one of the servants 
standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest Thou 
the high-priest so? Jesus answered him: If I have spoken 
evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest 
thou Me? And Annas sent Him bound to Caiphas the 
high-priest. And Simon Peter was standing and warming 
himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also 
one of His disciples? He denied it, and said: I am not. 
One of the servants of the high-priest (a kinsman to him 
whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did not I see thee 
in ihe garden with Him? Again therefore Peter denied: 
and immediately the cock crew. Then they led Jesus 
from Caiphas to the governor s hall. And it was morn- 



Epistles and Gospels. 1151 

ing: and they went not into the hall, that they might not 
be denied, but that they might eat the Pasch. Pilate 
therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation 
bring you against this man? They answered and said to 
him: If He were not a malefactor, we would not have 
delivered Him up to thee. Pilate therefore said to them: 
Take Him you, and judge Him according to your law. 
The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to 
put any man to death. That the word of Jesus might be 
fulfilled which He said, signifying what death He should 
die. Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called 
Jesus, and said to Him: Art Thou the King of the Jews? 
Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have 
others told it thee of Me? Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? 
Thy own nation, and the chief priests have delivered Thee 
up to me; what hast Thou done? Jesus answered: My 
kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of 
this world, My servants would certainly strive that I should 
not be delivered to the Jews: but now My kingdom is not 
from hence. Pilate therefore said to Him: Art Thou a 
king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a 
king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the 
world: that I should give testimony to the truth. Every 
one that is of the truth, heareth My voice. Pilate saith 
to Him: What is truth? And when he said this he went 
out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause 
in Him. But you have a custom that I should release 
one unto you at the Pasch : Will you therefore that I release 
unto you the King of the Jews? Then cried they all again, 
saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was 
a robber. Then therefore Pilate took Jesus, and scourged 
Him. And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put 
it upon His head: and they put on Him a purple garment. 
And they came to Him and said: Hail, King of the Jews, 
and they gave Him blows. Pilate therefore went forth 
again, and saith to them: Behold I bring Him forth unto 
you, that you may know that I find no cause in Him. 
(Jesus therefore came forth bearing the crown of thorns, 
and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold 
the man. When the chief priests therefore and the officers 
had seen Him, they cried out, saying: Crucify Him, 



1152 Epistles and Gospels. 

crucify Him! Pilate saith to them: Take Him you, and 
crucify Him, for I find no cause in Him. The Jews answered 
him: We have a law, and according to the law He ought 
to die, because He made Himself the Son of God. When 
Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more. 
And he entered into the hall again: and he said to Jesus: 
Whence art Thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate 
therefore saith to Him: Speakest Thou not to me? knowest 
Thou not that I have power to crucify Thee, and I have 
power to release Thee? Jesus answered: Thou shouldest 
not have any power against Me, unless it were given thee 
from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered Me to thee, 
hath the greater sin. And from thenceforth Pilate sought 
to release Hun. But the Jews cried out, saying: If 
thou release this man, thou art not Caesar s friend; for 
whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar. 
Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus 
forth: and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that 
is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it 
was the Parasceve of the Pasch, about the sixth hour, 
and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king. But they 
cried out: Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him. 
Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The 
chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar. 
Then, therefore, he delivered Him to them to be crucified. 
And they took Jesus, and led Him forth. And bearing 
His own cross, He went forth to that place which is called 
Calvary, but in Hebrew, Golgotha; where they crucified 
Him, and with Him two others, one on each side: and Jesus 
in the midst. And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put 
it upon the cross. And the writing was, Jesus of Nazareth, 
the King of the Jews. This title therefore, many of the 
Jews did read, because the place where Jesus was crucified 
was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in 
Greek, and in Latin. Then the chief priests of the Jews 
said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews: but that 
He said, I am the King of the Jews. Pilate answered: 
What I have written, I have written. The soldiers, there 
fore, when they had crucified Him, took His garments 
(and they made four parts: to every soldier a part), and 
also His coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven 



Epistles and Gospels. 1153 

from the top throughout. They said then one to another- 
Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shal* 
be. That the Scripture might be fulfilled saying: They 
have parted My garments among them, and upon My 
vesture they have cast lots. And the soldiers indeed 
did these things. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, 
His mother, and His mother s sister, Mary of Cleophas, 
and Mary Magdalen. When Jesus therefore had seen 
His mother, and the disciple, standing, whom He loved, 
He saith to His mother: Woman, behold thy son. After 
that, He saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And 
from that hour the disciple took her to his own. After 
wards Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, 
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst. Now 
there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they put 
ting a sponge full of vinegar about hyssop, put it to His 
mouth. Jesus therefore when He had taken the vinegar, 
said: It is consummated. And bowing His head, He 
gave up the ghost. 

[Here all kneel, and pause a little, to meditate on the redemp 
tion of mankind.] 

Then the Jews (because it was the Parasceve) that the 
bodies might not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath- 
day (for that was a great Sabbath-day), besought Pilate 
that their legs might be broken, and that they might be 
taken away. The soldiers, therefore, came: and they 
broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified 
with him. But after they were come to Jesus, when they 
saw that He was already dead, they did not break His 
legs. But one of the soldiers with a spear opened His 
side, and immediately there came out blood and water. 
And he that saw it hath given testimony: and his testi 
mony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true: that 
you also may believe. For these things were done that the 
Scripture might be fulfilled. You shall not break a bone 
of Him: And again another Scripture saith: They shall 
look on Him Whom they pierced. 

[Here the prayer " Munda cor meum " from the Ordinary 
of the Mass is said.] 

And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he 
was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) 



1 1 54 Epistles and Gospels. 

besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. 
And Pilate gave leave. He came therefore and took away 
the body of Jesus. And Nicodemus also came, he who at 
the first came to Jesus by night, bringing a mixture of 
myrrh and aloes, about an hundred-pound weight. They 
took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen 
cloths with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
Now there was in the place where He was crucified a garden 
and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein no man yet 
had been laid. There, therefore, because of the Parasceve 
of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was 
nigh at hand. 

HOLY SATURDAY. 

EPISTLE. Col. in. 1-4. Brethren: If you be risen with 
Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is 
sitting at the right hand of God: mind the things that are 
above, not the things that are upon the earth. For you 
are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When 
Christ shall appear, Who is your life, then you also shall 
appear with Him in glory. 

GOSPEL. Matt, xxviii. 1-7. In the end of the Sabbath, 
when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, 
came Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary, to see the 
sepulchre. And behold there was a great .earthquake. 
For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven; and 
coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it. And his 
countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow. 
And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, 
and became as dead men. And the angel answering, 
said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you 
seek Jesus Who was crucified: He is not here: for He is 
risen, as He said. Come and see the place where the Lord 
was laid. And going, quickly tell ye His disciples that He 
is risen: and behold He will go before you into Galilee: 
there you shall see Him : lo, I have foretold it to you. 

EASTER SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. O God, Who this day, by Thine only-begotten 
Son didst conquer death, opening unto us the gates of everlast 
ing life: to the desires of our hearts, which Thou inspirest, do 
Thou, by Thy gracious help, enable us to attain. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1155 

EPISTLE, i Cor. v. 7, 8. Brethren: Purge out the 
old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are un 
leavened. For Christ, our Pasch, is sacrificed. There 
fore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the 
leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened 
bread of sincerity and truth. 

GOSPEL. Mark xm. 1-7. At that time: Mary Mag 
dalen and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought 
sweet spices, that coming they might anoint Jesus. And 
very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they 
came to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen. And 
they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone 
from the door of the sepulchre? And looking, they saw the 
stone rolled back; for it was very great. And entering 
into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the 
right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were aston 
ished. Who saith to them: Be not affrighted: you seek 
Jesus of Nazareth, Who was crucified: He is risen, He 
is not here: behold the place where they laid Him. But 
go, tell His disciples and Peter that He goeth before you 
into Galilee: there you shall see Him, as He told you. 

LOW SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. Grant us, we beseech Thee, almighty God, in our 
hearts and in our manner of life, at all times to keep to Thee 
an Easter festival such as we have celebrated. 

EPISTLE, i John v. 4-10. Dearly Beloved: Whatso 
ever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is 
the victory which overcometh the world, our faith. Who 
is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth 
that Jesus is the Son of God? This is He that came by 
water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but 
by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth 
that Christ is the truth. And there are three who give 
testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy 
Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that 
give testimony on earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the 
blood, and these three are one. If we receive the testimony 
of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the 
testimony of God, which is greater, because He hath 



1156 Epistles and Gospels. 

testified of His Son. He that believeth in the Son of God, 
hath the testimony of God in himself. 

GOSPEL. John xx. 19-31. At that time: When it 
was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors 
were shut, where the disciples were gathered together for 
fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and 
said to them: Peace be to you. And when He had said 
this, He showed them His hands and His side. The 
disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. 
He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As 
the Father hath sent Me, I also send you. When He 
had said this He breathed on them; and He said to them: 
Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, 
they are forgiven them: and whose sins you shall retain, 
they are retained. Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who 
is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen 
the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in His 
hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place 
of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not 
believe. And after eight days again His disciples were 
within: and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors 
being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be 
to you. Then He saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger 
hither, and see My hands; and bring hither thy hand 
and put it into My side: and be not faithless but believing. 
Thomas answered and said to Him: My Lord, and my 
God. Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen Me, 
Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have 
not seen, and have believed. Many other signs also did 
Jesus in the sight of His disciples which are not written 
in this book. But these are written that you may believe 
that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God: and that believ 
ing you may have life in His name. 

SECOND SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. 

COLLECT. O God, Whose only-begotten Son, by humbling 
Himself, has raised up a fallen world: to Thy faithful people 
vouchsafe abiding joys. Thou hast snatched them from the 
certainty of eternal death; do Thou likewise ensure to each 
of them a part in that happiness which is everlasting. Others as 
on First Sunday of Advent, p. 1111. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1157 

EPISTLE. I Peter ii. 21-25. Dearly Beloved: Christ 
suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should 
follow His steps; Who did not sin, neither was guile found 
in His mouth. Who, when He was reviled, did not revile: 
when He suffered He threatened not: but delivered Him 
self to him that judged Him unjustly: Who His own self 
bore our sins in His body upon the tree: that we being 
dead to sins, should live to justice: by Whose stripes you 
were healed. For you were as sheep going astray, but 
you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your 
souls. 

GOSPEL. John x. 11-16. At that time Jesus said to 
the Pharisees: I am the good shepherd. The good 
shepherd giveth his life for his sheep. But the hireling 
and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are 
not, seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep, and 
flieth: and the wolf catcheth and scattereth the sheep, and 
the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling, and he hath 
no care for the sheep. I am the good shepherd: and I 
know Mine, and Mine know Me. As the Father knoweth 
Me, and I know the Father: and I lay down My life for 
My sheep. And other sheep I have, that are not of this 
fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear My 
voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd. 

THIRD SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. 

FEAST OF THE PATRONAGE OF ST. JOSEPH. 

COLLECT. O God, Who in the ineffable order of Thy prov 
idence wast pleased to choose blessed Joseph to be the Spouse 
of Thy most holy Mother: grant us, we beseech Thee, to deserve 
to have for our advocate in heaven him whom we venerate as 
our protector on earth. 

EPISTLE. Gen. xlix. 22-26. Joseph is a growing son, 
a growing son and comely to behold: the daughters run to 
and fro upon the wall. But they that held darts provoked 
him, and quarrelled with him, and envied him. His bow 
rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and 
his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one 
of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel. 



1158 Epistles and Gospels. 

The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty 
shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with 
the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with the 
blessings of the breasts and of the womb. The blessings 
of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his 
fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should 
come; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the 
crown of the Nazarite among his brethren. 

GOSPEL OF THE FEAST. Luke Hi. 21-23. At that time: 
It came to pass, when all the people were baptized, that 
Jesus also being baptized and praying, heaven was opened: 
and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape as a dove 
upon Him: and a voice came from heaven: Thou art My 
beloved Son: in Thee I am well pleased. And Jesus 
Himself was beginning about the age of thirty years, 
being, as it was supposed, the son of Joseph. 

Said at the end of the Mass. 

COLLECT FOR THE SUN-DAY. O God, Who upon them that go 
astray dost shed the light of Thy truth, leading them back into 
the paths of righteousness: upon all who profess to be Chris 
tians, bestow grace to put from them whatever befits not the 
name they bear, and to order their lives worthily thereof. 

GOSPEL OF THE SUNDAY. John xm. 16-22. At that time 
Jesus said to His disciples: A little while, and now you 
shall not see Me: and again a little while, and you shall 
see Me: because I go to the Father. Then some of His 
disciples said one to another: What is this that He saith 
to us: A little while, and you shall not see Me: and again 
a little while, and you shall see Me, and because I go to 
the Father? They said therefore: What is this that He 
saith, a little while? we know not what He speaketh. 
And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask Him, and He 
said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, 
because I said: A little while, and you shall not see Me: 
and again a little while, and you shall see Me. Amen, 
Amen, I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but 
the world shall rejoice: and you shall be made sorrowful, 
but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman, when 
she is in labor, hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but 
when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth 



Epistles and Gospels. 

no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the 
world. So also you now indeed have sorrow, but I will 
see you again, and your heart shall rejoice: and your joy 
no man shall take from you. 

FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. 

COLLECT. O God, Who makest Thy faithful servants to be 
of one mind and of one heart: teach us, Thy people, that only 
to love which Thou wiliest, that only to hope for, which Thou 
promisest; so that, amidst the manifold changes of this life, 
there only may our hearts abide, where alone true joys are found. 
Others as on p. 1111. 

EPISTLE. James i. 17-21. Dearly Beloved: Every 
best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down 
from the Father of lights, with Whom there is no change, 
nor shadow of alteration. For of His own will hath He 
begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some 
beginning of His creatures. You know, my dearest 
brethren, and let every man be swift to hear: but slow to 
speak, and slow to anger. For the anger of man worketh 
not the justice of God. Wherefore casting away all un- 
cleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness 
receive the engrafted word, which is able to save your 
souls. 

GOSPEL. John xvi. 5-14. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: I go to Him that sent Me; and none of you 
asketh Me: Whither goest Thou? But because I have 
spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 
But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: 
for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you: but if 
I go, I will send Him to you. And when He is come, He 
will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment ; 
of sin: because they believed not in Me. And of justice: 
because I go to the Father; and you shall see Me no longer. 
And of judgment: because the prince of this world is 
already judged. I have yet many things to say to you : but 
you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of 
truth is come, He will teach you all truth : for He shall not 
speak of Himself: but what things soever He shall hear, 
He shall speak, and the things that are to come He shall 
show you. He shall glorify Me: because He shall receive 
of Mine, and shall show it to you. 



1160 Epistles and Gospels. 



FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. 

COLLECT. O God, from Whom flow all good things, give 
ear to our supplication: and inspire us with determination to 
do what is right, and with steadfastness to carry out, guided 
by Thee, our good resolves. Others as on p. 1111. 

EPISTLE. James i. 22-27. Dearly Beloved: Be ye 
doers of the word, and not hearers only: deceiving your 
own selves. But if a man be a hearer of the word, and not 
a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own 
countenance in a glass: For he beheld himself, and went 
his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was. 
But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, 
and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful 
hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed 
in his deed. And if any man think himself to be religious, 
not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this 
man s religion is vain. Religion clean and undefiled before 
God and the Father, is this: To visit the fatherless and 
widows in their tribulation; and to keep one s self unspotted 
from this world. 

GOSPEL. John xvi. 23-30. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the 
Father anything in My name, He will give it you. Hitherto 
you have not asked anything in My name: Ask, and you 
shall receive, that your joy may be full. These things I have 
spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh when I will 
no more speak to you in proverbs, but will show you plainly 
of the Father: In that day you shall ask in My name: and 
I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you: For 
the Father Himself loveth you, because you have loved 
Me, and have believed that I came out from God. I came 
forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again 
I leave the world, and I go to the Father. His disciples 
say to Him : Behold now Thou speakest plainly, and speakest 
no proverb; now we know that Thou knowest all things, 
and Thou needest not that any man should ask Thee. By 
this we believe that Thou comest forth from God.

THE ASCENSION OF OUR LORD. 

COLLECT. Grant, O almighty God, we beseech Thee, that 
believing Thine only-begotten Son, our Redeemer, on this day 
to have ascended into heaven, we may also there, in heart, make 
our dwelling-place. 

EPISTLE. Acts i. i-n. The former treatise I made, O 
Theophilus, of all things which Jesus began to do and to 
teach until the day on which, giving commandments by 
the Holy Ghost to the apostles whom He had chosen, 
He was taken up: To whom also He showed Himself alive 
after His passion, by many proofs, for forty days appear 
ing to them, and speaking of the kingdom of God. And 
eating together with them, He commanded them that they 
should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for the 
promise of the Father, which you have heard, saith He. by 
My mouth: For John, indeed, baptized with water, but 
you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days 
hence. They therefore who were come together asked 
Him, saying: Lord, wilt Thou at this time restore again the 
kingdom to Israel? But He said to them: It is not for you 
to know the times or moments which the Father hath put 
in His own power. But you shall receive the power of the 
Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses 
unto Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and 
even to the uttermost part of the earth. And when He 
had said these things, while they looked on, He was raised 
up: and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And 
while they were beholding Him going up to heaven, behold 
two men stood by them in white garments, who also said: 
Ye men of Galilee, why stand you looking up to heaven? 
This Jesus Who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so 
come as you have seen Him going into heaven. 

GOSPEL. Mark xvi. 14-20. At that time: Jesus ap 
peared to the eleven as they were at table, and upbraided 
them with their incredulity and hardness of heart: because 
they did not believe them who had seen Him after He was 
risen again. And He said to them: Go ye into the whole 
world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that 
believeth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that be- 
lieveth not shall be condemned. And these signs shall 



1 1 62 Epistles and Gospels. 

follow them that believe: In My name they shall cast out 
devils: they shall speak with new tongues: they shall take 
up serpents: and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it 
shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the 
sick, and they shall recover. And the Lord Jesus, after 
He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and 
sitteth on the right hand of God. But they going forth 
preached everywhere, the Lord working withal, and con 
firming the word with signs that followed. 

SUNDAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE OF THE 
ASCENSION. 

COLLECT. Almighty and merciful God, grant that our service 
of Thy divine majesty may ever be that of a devoted will and 
of a pure heart. Also Collect of Ascension Day, p. 1161. 

EPISTLE, i Peter iv. 7-11. Dearly Beloved: Be pru 
dent, and watch in prayers. But before all things have a 
constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity 
covereth a multitude of sins. Using hospitality one to 
wards another without murmuring. As every man hath 
received grace, ministering the same to one "another, as 
good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man 
speak let him speak as the words of God. If any man 
minister, let him do it as of the power which God adminis- 
tereth: that in all things God may be honored through 
Jesus Christ. 

GOSPEL. John xv. 26, 27; xvi. 1-4. At that time Jesus 
said to His disciples : When the Paraclete cometh Whom 
I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, Who 
proceedeth from the Father, He shall give testimony 
of Me: And you shall give testimony, because you are 
with Me from the beginning. These things have I spoken 
to you, that you may not be scandalized. They will put 
you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh that 
whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to 
God. And these things will they do to you, because they 
have not known the Father nor Me. But these things I 
have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may 
remember that I told you of them. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1163 

FEAST OF PENTECOST, OR WHITSUNDAY. 

COLLECT. O God, Who hast this day taught the hearts of 
the faithful by the light of the Holy Ghost: grant that, by the 
gift of the same Spirit, we may always be truly wise and ever 
rejoice in His holy consolations. 

EPISTLE. Adsii.i-n. When the days of the Pentecost 
were accomplished, they were all together in one place: 
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a 
mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where 
they were sitting. And there appeared to them parted 
tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of 
them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and 
they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the 
Holy Ghost gave them to speak. Now there were dwelling 
at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation under 
heaven. And when this was noised abroad, the multitude 
came together, and were confounded in mind, because that 
every man heard them speak in his own tongue. And they 
were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all 
these that speak Galileans? And how have we heard 
every man our own tongue wherein we were born? Par- 
thians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of 
Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia, 
Phrygia, and Pamphilia, Egypt, and the parts of Lybia 
about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews also, and prose 
lytes, Cretes. and Arabians: we have heard them speak 
in our own tongues the wonderful works of God. 

GOSPEL. John xiv. 23-31. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: If any one love Me, he will keep My word, 
and My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and 
will make our abode with him. He that loveth Me not, 
keeoeth not My words. And the word which you have 
hdpl is not Mine: but the Father s Who sent Me. These 
tgs have I spoken to you, abiding with you. But the 
Taraclete, the Holy Ghost, Whom the Father will send in 
My name, He will teach you all things, and bring all things 
to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you. Peace 
I leave with you; My peace I give unto you: not as the 
world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be 
troubled, nor let it be afraid. You have heard that I said 
to you: I go away and I come unto you. If you loved 



1164 Epistles and Gospels. 

Me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father; 
for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told 
you before it came to pass: that when it shall come to pass, 
you may believe. I will not now speak many things with 
you: for the prince of this world cometh, and in Me he hath 
not anything. But that the world may know that I love 
the Father: and as the Father hath given Me command 
ment, so do I. 

TRINITY SUNDAY. 

COLLECT. Almighty and everlasting God, Who hast given to 
Thy servants, in their confessing of the true faith, to bear wit 
ness to the glory of the eternal Trinity, and to adore the Unity 
in might of its majesty: vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, that 
our steadfast holding to that same faith may be our defence in 
all adversity. 

EPISTLE. Rom. xi. 33-36. O the depth of the riches 
of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incom 
prehensible are His judgments, and how unsearchable 
His ways! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? 
Or who hath been His counsellor? Or who hath first given 
to Him. and recompense shall be made him? For of Him, 
and by Him, and in Him, are all things; to Him be glory 
for ever. Amen. 

GOSPEL. Matt, xxviii. 18-20. At that time Jesus said 
to his disciples : All power is given to Me in heaven and in 
earth: going therefore teach ye all nations, baptizing them 
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things what 
soever I have commanded you, and behold I am with you 
all days, even to the consummation of the world. 

FIRST SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT OF THE SUNDAY. O God, the strength of all who 
hope in Thee, listen in Thy mercy to our supplications: and 
since, unless Thou help, the weakness of our human nature 
availeth not at all, replenish us with Thy grace, that in the 
keeping of Thy commandments, both by our will to serve Thee, 
and by our actions, we may be well-pleasing in Thy sight. 

EPISTLE. I John iv. 8-21. Dearly Beloved: God is 
charity. By this hath the charity of God appeared towards 
us, because God hath sent His only-begotten Son into the 



Epistles and Gospels. 1165 

world, that we may live by Him. In this is charity; not 
as though we had loved God, but because He hath first loved 
us, and sent His Son to be a propitiation for our sins. My 
dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one 
another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love 
one another God abideth in us, and His charity is per 
fected in us. In this we know that we abide in Him, and 
He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit. And 
we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath sent 
His Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever shall 
confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, 
and he in God. And we have known and have believed 
the charity which God hath to us. God is charity; and 
he that abideth in charity abideth in God, and God in him. 
In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may 
have confidence in the day of judgment, because as he is, 
we also are in this world. Fear is not in charity; but 
perfect charity casteth out fear because fear hath pain; 
and he that feareth is not perfected in charity. Let us 
therefore love God because God first hath loved us. If any 
man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. 
For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can 
he love God Whom he seeth not? And this commandment 
we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his 
brother. 

GOSPEL. Luke m. 36-42. At that time Jesus said to His 
disciples: Be ye merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and 
you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be 
forgiven. Give, and it shall be given to you: good measure 
and pressed down and shaken together and running over 
shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure 
that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you 
again. And He spoke also to them a similitude: Can the 
blind lead the blind? do they not both fall into the ditch? 
The disciple is not above his master: but every one shall 
be perfect, if he be as his master. And why seest thou the 
mote in thy brother s eye: but the beam that is in thy own 
eye thou considerest not? Or how canst thou say to thy 
brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye: 
when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye? 



1 1 66 Epistles and Gospels. 

Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye: and 
then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy 
brother s eye. 

CORPUS CHRIST!. 

COLLECT. O God, Who in this wonderful sacrament hast 
left us a memorial of Thy passion: grant us, we beseech Thee, 
so to reverence the sacred mysteries of Thy body and blood, 
that we may ever feel within us the fruit of Thy redemption. 

EPISTLE. / Cor. xi. 23-29. Brethren: For I have 
received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, 
that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was be 
trayed, took bread, and giving thanks, broke and said: 
Take ye and eat : This is My body, which shall be delivered 
for you: this do for the commemoration of Me. In like 
manner also the chalice, after He had supped, saying: 
This chalice is the New Testament in My blood : this do ye 
as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of Me. 
For as often as you shall eat this bread and drink the chalice, 
you shall show the death of the Lord until He come: There 
fore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of 
the Lord unworthily: shall be guilty of the body and of the 
blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself: and so 
let him eat of that bread and drink of the chalice. For he 
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh 
judgment to himself: not discerning the body of the Lord. 

GOSPEL. John vi. 56-59. At that time Jesus said to 
the multitude of the Jews: My flesh is meat indeed: and 
My blood is drink indeed; he that eateth My flesh, and 
drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him. As 
the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: 
so he that eateth Me, the same also shall live by Me. This 
is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your 
fathers did eat manna and are dead. He that eateth this 
bread shall live for ever. 

SECOND SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT. Do Thou, O Lord, bestow upon us, both an abiding 
fear and an abiding love of Thy holy name: for those to whom 
Thou teachest the depths of Thy love, at no time dost Thou fail 
to govern by Thy grace. Also Collect as"_on Corpus Christi. 

EPISTLE. I John Hi. 13-18. Dearly Beloved : Wonder 
not, if the world hate you. We know that we have passed 



Epistles and Gospels. 1167 

from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that 
loveth not abideth in death : Whosoever hateth his brother, 
is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath 
eternal life abiding in himself. In this we have known 
the charity of God, because He hath laid down His life for 
us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his 
brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him, how 
doth the charity of God abide in him? My little children, 
let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and in 
truth. 

GOSPEL. Luke xiv. 16-24. At that time Jesus spoke 
to the Pharisees this parable: A certain man made a 
great supper, and invited many. And he sent his servant 
at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited that 
they should come, for now all things are ready. And they 
began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: 
I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it; 
I pray thee, hold me excused. And another said: I have 
bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try them; I pray thee, 
hold me excused. And another said: I have married a 
wife, and therefore I cannot come. And the servant 
returning told these things to his lord. Then the master 
of the house, being angry, said to his servant: go out 
quickly into the streets and lanes of the city: and bring in 
hither the poor and the feeble, and the blind and the lame. 
And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou has com 
manded, and yet there is room. And the lord said to the 
servant: Go out into the highways and hedges; and compel 
them to come in, that my house may be filled. But I say 
unto you that none of those men that were invited, shall 
taste of my supper. 

FEAST OF THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS. 

COLLECT. O almighty God, we entreat Thee, give unto us 
who, calling to mind the inestimable blessings we owe to its 
love of us, glory in the most sacred Heart of Thy beloved Son, 
to make it our delight to dwell in thought, both on those same 
blessings and on the fruit we -gather therefrom. 

EPISTLE Isaias xii. 1-6. I will give thanks to Thee, 
O Lord, for Thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned

away and Thou hast comforted me. Behold God is my 
Saviour. I will deal confidently, and will not fear; because 
the Lord is my strength, and my praise, and He is become 
my salvation. You shall draw waters with joy out of the 
Saviour s fountains. And you shall say in that day: 
Praise ye the Lord, and call upon His name: make His 
inventions known among the people: remember that His 
name is high. Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath done 
great things: show this forth in all the earth. Rejoice, 
and praise, O thou habitation of Sion : for great is He that 
is in the midst of thee, the Holy One of Israel. 

GOSPEL. John xix. 31-35. At that time: The Jews 
(because it was the Parasceve), that the bodies might hot 
remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-day (for that was 
a great Sabbath-day), besought Pilate that their legs might 
be broken, and that they might be taken away. The 
soldiers, therefore, came; and they broke the legs of the 
first, and of the other that was crucified with him. But 
after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that He was 
already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of the 
soldiers, with a spear, opened His side, and immediately 
there came out blood and water. And he that saw it 
hath given testimony: and his testimony is true. 

THIRD SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT. I. O God, the protector of all who,hope"in Thee,

cause your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth

Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will Himself perfect 
you, and confirm you, and establish you. To Him be glory

GOSPEL. Luke xv. i-io. At that time: The publicans 
and sinners drew near unto Him to hear Him. And the 
Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying: This man re- 
ceiveth sinners, and eateth with them. And He spoke to 
them this parable, saying: What man o ; you that hath an 
hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he 
not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that 
which was lost until he find it? And when he hath found 
it, lay it upon his shoulders rejoicing; and coming home 
call together his friends and neighbors, saying to them: 
Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was 
lost? I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven 
upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety- 
nine just who need not penance. Or what woman having 
ten groats, if she lose one groat, .doth not light a candle 
and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it? 
And when she hath found it, call together her friends and 
neighbors, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found 
the groat which I had lost. So I say to you, there shall be 
joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.

EPISTLE. Ram. mil. 18-23. Brethren: I reckon that 
the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared 
with the glory to come, that shall be revealed to us. For 
the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of 
the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to 
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him that made it 
subject, in hope: Because the creature also itself shall be 
delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty 
of the glory of the children of God. For we know that 
every creature groaneth, and travaileth in pain even till 
now. And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the 



1170 Epistles and Gospels. 

first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within 
ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, 
the redemption of our body. 

GOSPEL. Luke v. i-n. At that time: When the 
multitudes pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, 
He stood by the lake of Genesareth. And saw two ships 
standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out 
of them, and were washing their nets. And going into one 
of the ships that was Simon s, He desired him to draw back a 
little from the land. And sitting, He taught the multitudes 
out of the ship. Now when He had ceased to speak, He 
said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down 
your nets for a draught. And Simon answering said to 
Him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have 
taken nothing: but at Thy word I will let down the net. 
And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great 
multitude of fishes, and their net broke. And they beckoned 
to their partners that were in the other ship, that they 
should come and help them. And they came and filled 
both the ships, so that they were almost sinking: which, 
when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus knees, say 
ing: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, 
at the draught of the fishes which they had taken. And 
so were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who 
were Simon s partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear 
not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men. And having 
brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed 
Him. 

FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT. I. O God, Who for them that love Thee hast prepared

of the heart of man.

EPISTLE. I Peter Hi. 5-/j. Dearly Beloved: Be ye 

all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being 

-lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble: 



Epistles and Gospels. 1171 

Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but 
contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that 
you^ma.y_ inherit a blessing, r or ne that will love lite, and 
see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and 
his lips that they speak no guile. Let him decline from 
evil, and do good: let him seek after peace, and pursue it, 
because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and His 
ears unto their prayers; but the countenance of the Lord 
upon them that do evil things. And who is he that can 
hurt you, if you be zealous of good? But if also you suffer 
anything for justice sake, blessed are ye. And be not 
afraid of their fear, and be not troubled; but sanctify the 
Lord Christ in your hearts. 

GOSPEL. Matt. v. 20-24. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: I tell you, unless your justice abound more 
than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was 
said to them of old: Thou shalt not kill: and whosoever 
shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say 
to you: that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be 
in danger of the judgment. And whosoever shall say to 
his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. And 
whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell 
fire. If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar, and there 
thou remember that thy brother hath anything against 
thee: Leave there thy offering before the altar, and go 
first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou 
shalt offer thy gift. 

SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

kindness, of that which Thou fosterest, be Thyself the safeguard.

EPISTLE. Rom. vi. 3-11. Brethren: All we, who are 
baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death. For 
we are buried together with Him by baptism into death: 
that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the 
Father so we also may walk in newness of life. For if we 



1172 Epistles and Gospels. 

have been planted together in the likeness of His death, 
we shall be also in the likeness^of His resurrection. Know 
ing tin s, that our old man is crucified, with Him, that_the 
body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may 
serve sin no longer. For he that is dead is justified from sin. 
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall 
live also together with Christ: knowing that Christ rising 
again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no 
more have dominion over Him. For in that He died to 
sin, He died once; but in that He liveth, He liveth unto 
God. So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but 
alive untoj^ficl in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
GOSPEL? Mark "viii. 1-9. At that time: When there 
was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat, calling His 
disciples together, He saith to them: I have compassion 
on the multitude; for behold they have now been with 
Me three days, and have nothing to eat. And if I shall 
send them away fasting to their home, they will faint 
in the way; for some of them came from afar off. And 
His disciples answered Him: From whence can any one 
fill them here with bread in the wilderness? And He asked 
them: How many loaves have ye? who said: Seven. 
And He commanded the multitude to sit down upon the 
ground. And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, 
He broke, and gave to His disciples for to set before them, 
and they set them before the people. And they had a 
few little fishes, and He blessed them, and commanded 
them to be set before them. And they did eat and were 
filled and they took up that which was left of the frag 
ments, seven baskets. And they that had eaten were 
about four thousand: and He sent them away.

EPISTLE. Rom.vi. 19-23. Brethren: -I speak an human 
thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you 



Epistles and Gospels. 1173 

have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and in 
iquity, unto iniquity, so now yield your members to serve 
justice, unto sanctification. For when you were the ser 
vants of sin, you were free men to justice. What fruit 
therefore had you then in those things of which you are 
now ashamed? For the end of them is death. But now 
being made free from sin, and become servants of God, 
you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life 
everlasting. For the wages of sin is death. But the 
grace of God, life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
GOSPEL. Matt. vii. 15-21. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: Beware of false prophets, who come to you 
in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening 
wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men 
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every 
good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth 
evil fruit: neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit: 
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut 
down, and shall be cast into the fire. Wherefore by their 
fruits you shall know them. Not every one that saith 
to Me: Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: 
but he that doth the will of My Father Who is in heaven, 
he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. 

EIGHTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT. I. Impart to us, in Thy mercy, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, the grace, at all times, both to think and to do what is 
right in Thy sight: that we, who but for Thee could not even 
have our being, may live only to fulfil Thy holy will.

live according to the flesh, you shall die, but if by the 
Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live. 
For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the 
sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of 
bondage again in fear, but you have received the spirit 
of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father). 
For the Spirit Himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that 



H74 Epistles and Gospels. 

we are the sons of God. And if sons, heirs also; heirs 
indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ. 

GOSPEL. Luke ocvi. i-p. At that time: He said also 
to His disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a 
steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had 
wasted his goods. And he called him, and said to him: 
How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy 
stewardship; for now thou canst be steward no longer. 
And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, 
because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? 
To dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed. I know what 
I will do, that when I shall be removed from the steward 
ship, they may receive me into their houses. Therefore 
calling together every one of his lord s debtors, he said 
to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord? But 
he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: 
Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty. Then 
he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who 
said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: 
Take thy bill and write eighty. And the lord commended 
the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for 
the children of this world are wiser in their generation 
than the children of light. And I say to you: Make unto 
you friends of the mammon of iniquity, that when you 
shall fail they may receive you into everlasting dwellings. 

NINTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither 
let us commit fornication, as some of them committed 
fornication, and there fell in one day three-and-twenty 
thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them 
tempted, and perished by the serpents. Neither do you

murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed 
by the destroyer. Now all these things happened to them 
in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon 
whom the ends of the world are come. Wherefore he 
that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he 
fall. Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as 
is human: and God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to 
be tempted above that which you are able, but will make 
also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. 
GOSPEL. Luke xix. 41-47. At that time: When He 
drew near Jerusalem, seeing the city, He wept over it, 
saying: If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy 
day, the things that are to thy peace, but now they are 
hidden from thy eyes. For the days shall come upon 
thee; and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and 
compass thee round: and straiten thee on every side: 
and beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are 
in thee, and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a 
stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visita 
tion. And entering into the Temple, He began to cast 
out them that sold therein, and them that bought, saying 
to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer; 
but you have made it a den of thieves. And He was teach 
ing daily in the Temple.

when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, accord

that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema 
to Jesus. And no man can say, the Lord Jesus, but by 
the Holy Ghost. Now there are diversities of graces, but 
the same Spirit: and there are diversities of ministries, 
but the same Lord: and there are diversities of operations, 



1176 Epistles and Gospels. 

but the same God, Who worketh all in all. And the 
manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto 
profit. To one, indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word 
of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, accord 
ing to the same Spirit: to another, faith in the same Spirit: 
to another, the grace of healing, in one Spirit: to another 
the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another 
the discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, 
to another interpretation of speeches. But all these things 
one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one 
according as He will. 

GOSPEL. Luke xviii. 9-14. At that time: To some 
who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, 
He spoke also this parable: Two men went up into the 
Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publi 
can. The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus with himself: 

God! I give Thee thanks that I am not as the rest of 
men; extortioners, unjust, adulterers: as also is this publi 
can; I fast twice in a week; I give tithes of all that I 
possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not 
so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven: but struck 
his breast, saying: O God! be merciful to me a sinner! 

1 say to you, this man went down to his house justified 
rather than the other, because every one that exalteth 
himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself 
shall be exalted.

you have received, and wherein you stand, by which 
also you are saved: if you hold fast after what manner I 
preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1177 

For I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also 
received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to 
the Scriptures: And that He was buried, and that He rose 
again the third day according to the Scriptures: And that 
He was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven. 
Then was He seen by more than five hundred brethren at 
once, of whom many remain until this present, and some 
are fallen asleep. After that He was seen by James, then 
by all the apostles: and last of all, He was seen also by 
me as by one born out of due time. For I am the least 
of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, 
because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the 
grace of God I am what I am : and His grace in me hath 
not been void. 

GOSPEL. Mark mi. 31-37. At that time: Going out 
of the coasts of Tyre, He came by Sidon to the Sea of 
Galilee, through the midst of the coast of Decapolis. And 
they bring to Him one deaf and dumb: and they besought 
Him that He would lay His hand upon him. And taking 
him from the multitude apart, He put His fingers into 
his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue: and looking 
up to heaven, He groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, 
which is, be thou opened. And immediately his ears were 
opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he 
spoke right. And He charged them that they should tell 
no man. But the more He charged them, so much the 
more a great deal did they publish it: And so much the 
more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well : 
He hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

with letters upon stones, was glorious, so that the children 
of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses,

how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather in

His disciples: Blessed are the eyes that see the things 
which you see. For I say to you that many prophets and 
kings have desired to see the things that you see, and have 
not seen them: and to hear the things that you hear, 
and have not heard them. And behold a certain lawyer 
stood up, tempting Him, and saying: Master, what must I 
do to possess eternal life? But He said to him: What is 
written in the law? how readest thou? He answering, 
said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole 
heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, 
and with all thy mind: and thy neighbor as thyself. And 
He said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and 
thou shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself, said 
to_ Jesus: And who is my neighbor? And Jesus answering 
said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, 
and fell among robbers, who also stripped him: and, hav 
ing wounded him, went away leaving him half dead. And 
it chanced that a certain priest went down the same way: 
and seeing him, passed by. In like manner also a Levite, 
when he was near the place and saw him, passed by. But 
a certain Samaritan being on his journey came near him: 
and seeing him, was moved with compassion. And going 
up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: 
and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an 
inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took out 
two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of 
him: and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, 
I at; my return will repay thee. Which of these three in 
thy opinion was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers? 
But he said: He that showed mercy to him. And Jesus 
said to him : Go and do thou in like manner.

EPISTLE. Gal. Hi. 16-22. Brethren: To Abraham were 
the promises made and to his seed. He saith not: And 
to his seeds, as of many: but as of one: And to thy seed, 
which is Christ. Now this I say, that the testament 
which was confirmed by God: the law which was made 
after four hundred and thirty years, doth not annul, to 
make the promise of no effect. For if the inheritance be 
of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to 
Abraham by promise. Why then was the law? It was 
set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, 
to whom He made the promise, being ordained by angels 
in the hands of a mediator. Now a mediator is not of one: 
but God is one. Was the law then against the promises 
of God. God forbid. For if there had been a law given 
which could give life, verily justice should have been by 
the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, 
that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given 
to them that believe. 

GOSPEL. Luke xvii. n-ig. At that time: As He was 
going to Jerusalem, He passed through the midst of Samaria 
and Galilee. And as He entered into a certain town, 
there met Him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off: 
And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, Master, have 
mercy on us. Whom when He saw, He said: Go show 
yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they 
went they were made clean. And one of them, when he 
saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice 
glorifying God, and he fell on his face, before His feet, 
giving thanks; and this was a Samaritan. And Jesus 
answering, said: Were not ten made clean? and where 
are the nine? There is no one found to return and give 
glory to God but this stranger. And He said to him; 
Arise, go thy way: for thy faith hath made thee whole.

hurtful things, and lead us to those that profit us to salvation. 

II. Save us (as on Ash Wednesday). 

III. At choice. 

EPISTLE. Gal. v. 16-24. Brethren: I say then, walk 
in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. 
For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit 
against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: 
so that you do not the things that you would. But if 
you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law. Now 
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornication, 
uncleanness, immodesty, luxury, idolatry, witchcrafts, 
enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dis 
sensions, sects, envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, 
and such like, of which I foretell you, as I have foretold 
to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the 
kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, 
joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity, 
mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against 
such there is no law. And they that are Christ s have 
crucified their flesh with the vices and concupiscences. 

GOSPEL. Malt. m. 24-33. At that time Jesus said to 
His disciples: No man can serve two masters: for either 
he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain 
the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God 
and mammon. Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous 
for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what 
you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat, 
and the body more than the raiment? Behold the birds 
of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather 
into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. 
Are not you of much more value than they? And which of 
you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 
And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the 
lilies of the field how they grow: they labor not, neither 
do they spin. But I say to you, that not even Solomon in 
all his glory was arrayed as one of these. And if the grass 
of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into the 



Epistles and Gospels. 1181 

oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, ye of 
little faith? Be not solicitous, therefore, saying: What 
shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we 
be clothed? For after all these things do the heathens seek. 
For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these 
things. Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God and 
His justice: and all these things shall be added unto you. 

FIFTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. 

COLLECT. I. May Thine abiding loving-kindness, O Lord, 
cleanse and fortify Thy Church: and, forasmuch as without 
Thee it can never be well with her, may it be at all times Thy 
grace that governs her. 

II. Save us (as on Ash Wednesday). 

III. At choice. 

EPISTLE. Gal. v. 25, 26; vi. i-io. Brethren: If we 
live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not 
be made desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, 
envying one another. And if a man be overtaken in any 
fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the 
spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be 
tempted. Bear ye one another s burdens, and so you shall 
fulfil the law of Christ. For if any man think himself to be 
something, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall have 
glory in himself only, and not in another. For every one 
shall bear his own burden. And let him that is instructed 
in the word communicate to him that instructeth him, in 
all good things. Be not deceived: God is not mocked. 
For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. 
For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap 
corruption: but he that soweth in the Spirit, of the Spirit 
shall reap life everlasting. And in doing good, let us not 
fail: for in due time we shall reap, not failing. Therefore, 
whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but espe 
cially to those who are of the household of the faith. 

GOSPEL. Luke mi. 11-16. At that time: Jesus went 
into a city that is called Nairn: and there went with Him 
His disciples, and a great multitude. And when He came 
nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was car 
ried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: 



1 1 82 Epistles and Gospels. 

and a great multitude of the city was with her. Whom 
when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards 
her, He said to her: Weep not. And He came near and 
touched the bier. (And they that carried it stood still.) 
And He said: Young man, I say to thee, Arise. And he 
that was dead sat up and began to speak. And He gave 
him to his mother. And there came a fear on them all: 
and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up 
among us: and God hath visited His people.

EPISTLE. Eph. Hi. 13-21. Brethren: I pray you not 
to faint at my tribulations for you: which is your glory. 
For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of Our Lord 
Jesus Christ, of Whom all paternity in heaven and earth 
is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches 
of His glory, to be strengthened by His Spirit with might 
unto the inward man, that Christ may dwell by faith in 
your hearts: that being rooted and founded in charity, 
you may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what 
is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth: To 
know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all 
knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness 
of God. Now to Him Who is able to do all things more 
abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the 
power that worketh in us: to Him be glory in the Church, 
and in Christ Jesus, unto all generations, world without 
end. Amen. 

GOSPEL. Luke xiv. i-n. At that time: When Jesus 
went into the house of one of the chief of the Pharisees, 
on the Sabbath-day, to eat bread, they watched Him. 
And behold there was a certain man before Him that had 
the dropsy. And Jesus answering, spoke to the lawyers 
and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath- 
day? But they held their peace. But He, taking him, 
healed him, and sent him away. And answering them, 



Epistles and Gospels. 1183 

He said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a 
pit, and will not immediately draw him out on the Sab 
bath-day? And they could not answer Him to these things. 
And He spoke a parable also to them that were invited, 
marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying 
to them: When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not 
down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honorable 
than thou be invited by him, and he that inviteth thee and 
him, come and say to thee: Give this man place: and 
then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place: but 
when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place: 
that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: 
Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before 
them that sit at the table with thee. Because every one 
that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that hum- 
bleth himself shall be exalted. 

SEVENTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

the temptations of the devil: and, pure in heart, to follow Thee,

EPISTLE. Eph. iv. 1-6. Brethren: I, a prisoner in the 
Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation 
in which you are caHed, with all humility and mildness, 
with patience, supporting one another in charity, careful 
to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. One 
body and one spirit, as you are called in one hope of your 
calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and 
Father of all. Who is above all, and through all, and in 
us all. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xxii. 35-46. At that time the Pharisees 
came nigh to Jesus: And one of them, a doctor of the law, 
asked Him, tempting Him: Master, which is the great 
commandment in the law? Jesus said to him: Thou shalt 
love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy 
whole soul, and with thy whole mind. This is the greatest 
and the first commandment. And the second is like to 
this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these 
two commandments dependeth the whole law and the 



1184 Epistles and Gospels. 

prophets. And the Pharisees being gathered together, 
Jesus asked them, saying: What think you of Christ? 
Whose Son is He? They say to Him: David s. He saith 
to them: How then doth David in spirit call Him Lord, 
saying: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on My right hand, 
until I make Thy enemies Thy footstool? If David then 
call Him Lord, how is He his Son? And no man was able 
to answer Him a word: neither durst any man from that 
day forth ask Him any more questions. 

EIGHTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

EPISTLE, i Cor. i. 4-8. Brethren: I give thanks 
to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is 
given you in Christ Jesus: That in all things you are 
made rich in Him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge: 
As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: So that 
nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the 
manifestation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who also will 
confirm unto the end without crime, in the day of the 
coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ. 

GOSPEL. Matt. ix. 1-8. At that time: Entering into 
a boat, He passed over the water and came into His own 
city. And behold they brought to Him one sick of the 
palsy lying in a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said 
to the man sick of the palsy: Be of good heart, son, thy 
sins are forgiven thee. And behold some of the scribes 
said within themselves: He blasphemeth. And Jesus 
seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your 
hearts? Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven 
thee: or to say: Arise and walk? But that you may know 
that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, 
then said He to the man sick of the palsy: Arise, take up 
thy bed and go into thy house. And he arose and went 
into his house. And the multitude seeing it feared, and 
glorified God that gave such power to men.

NINTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

in mind and body, we may readily devote ourselves to the doing

EPISTLE. Eph. iv. 23-28. Brethren; Be renewed in 
the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man, who, 
according to God, is created in justice, and holiness of truth. 
Wherefore, putting away lying, speak ye the truth every 
man with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. 
Be angry, and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your 
anger. Give not place to the devil. He that stole, let 
him now steal no more, but rather let him labor, working 
with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have 
something to give to him that suffereth need. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xxii. 2-14. At that time Jesus spoke 
to the chief priests and Pharisees in parables, saying: 
The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a 
marriage for his son. And he sent his servants to call 
them that were invited to the marriage: and they would 
not come. Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell 
them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner, 
my beeves and fallings are killed, and all things are ready: 
come ye to the marriage. But they neglected: and went 
their ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise. 
And the rest laid hands on his servants, and, having treated 
them contumeliously, put them to death. But when the 
king had heard of it, he was angry, and, sending his armies, 
he destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. 
Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is 
ready; but they that were invited were not worthy. Go 
ye therefore into the highways, and as many as you shall 
find, call to the marriage. And his servants going forth 
into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both 
bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests. 
And the king went in to see the guests, and he saw there a 
man who had not on a wedding garment. And he saith 
to him: Friend, how earnest thou in hither, not having 



1 1 86 Epistles and Gospels. 

on a wedding garment? But he was silent. Then the king 
said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him 
into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen. 



TWENTIETH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST.

EPISTLE. Eph. v. 15-21. See, brethren, how you walk 
circumspectly; not as unwise, but as wise: redeeming the

unwise; but understanding what is the will of God. And 
be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled 
with the Holy Spirit. Speaking to yourselves in psalms, 
and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making 
melody in your hearts, to the Lord, giving thanks always 
for all things, in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, to God 
and the Father: being subject one to another in the fear 
of Christ. 

Gospel. John iv. 46-53. At that time: There was a 
certain ruler whose son was sick at Capharnaum. He 
having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, 
went to Him, and prayed Him to come down and heal his 
son, for he was at the point of death. Jesus therefore said 
to him: Unless you see signs and wonders you believe not. 
The ruler saith to Him: Lord, come down before that my 
son die. Jesus saith to him: Go thy way, thy son liveth. 
The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and 
went his way. And as he was going down, his servants 
met him: and they brought word, saying that his son 
lived. He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he 
grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday at the 
seventh hour the fever left him. The father therefore 
knew that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him: 
Thy son liveth: and himself believed and his whole house.

EPISTLE. Eph. vi. 10-17. Brethren: Be strengthened 
in the Lord, and in the might of His power. Put you on 
the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against 
the deceits of the devil; for our wrestling is not against 
flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, 
against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the 
spirits of wickedness in the high places. Therefore take 
unto you the armor of God. that you may be able to resist 
in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect. Stand 
therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and 
having on the breast-plate of justice, and your feet shod 
with the preparation of the gospel of peace: In all things 
taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to 
extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one: And 
take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of 
the Spirit (which is the word of God). 

GOSPEL. Matt, xviii. 23-35. At that time Jesus spoke 
to His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven is 
likened to a king who would take an account of his servants. 
And when he had begun to take the account, one was brought 
to him that owed him ten thousand talents. And as he 
had not wherewith to pay it, his lord commanded that 
he should be sold, and his wife and children, and all that 
he had, and payment to be made. But that servant falling 
down, besought him saying: Have patience with me and 
I will pay thee all. And the lord of that servant, being 
moved with pity, let him go, and forgave him the debt. 
But when that servant was gone out, he found one of his 
fellow-servants that owed him an hundred pence: and 
laying hold of him, he throttled him, saying: Pay what 
thou owest. And his fellow-servant falling down, besought 
him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will pay thee 
all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, 
till be paid the debt. Now his fellow-servants, seeing what 



11 88 Epistles and Gospels. 

was done, were very much grieved: and they came and told 
their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him- 
and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee ali 
the debt, because thou besoughtest me: Shouldst not 
thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow-servant, 
even as I had compassion on thee? And his lord being 
angry, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the 
debt. So also shall My heavenly Father do to you, if 
you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.

EPISTLE. Phil. i. 6-n. Brethren: Being confident 
of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in 
you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus: as it is 
meet for me to think this for you all; for that I have you 
in my heart: and that in my bonds, and in the defence 
and _ confirmation of the Gospel, you all are partakers of 
my joy. For God is my witness, how I long after you all 
in the bowels of Jesus Christ. And this I pray, that your 
charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and 
in all understanding: That you may approve the better 
things, that you may be sincere and without offence 
unto the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of justice through 
Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xxli. 15-21. At that time: The 
Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to en 
snare Him in His speech. And they sent to Him their 
disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that 
Thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in 
truth, neither carest Thou for any man: for Thou dost not 
regard the person of men: Tell us therefore what dost 
Thou think: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? 
But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you 
tempt Me, ye hypocrites? Show Me the coin of the tribute. 



Epistles and Gospels. 1189 

And they offered Him a penny. And Jesus saith to them: 
Whose image and inscription is this? They say to Him: 
Caesar s. Then He saith to them: Render therefore to 
Caesar the things that are Caesar s, and to God the things 
that are God s.

EPISTLE. Phil. Hi. 17-21; iv. i-j. Be followers of me, 
brethren, and observe them who walk so as you have our 
model. For many walk, of whom I- have told you often 
(and now tell you weeping) that they are enemies of the 
cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction: whose God is 
their belly: and whose glory is in their shame, who mind 
earthly things. But our conversation is in heaven; from 
whence also we look for the Saviour, Our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the 
body of His glory, according to the operation whereby also 
He is able to subdue all things unto Himself. Therefore, 
my dearly-beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy 
and my crown : so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved : 
I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche to be of one mind 
in the Lord. And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, 
help those women that have labored with me in the Gospel 
with Clement and the rest of my fellow-laborers, whose 
names are in the Book of Life. 

GOSPEL. Matt. ix. 18-26. At that time: As He was 
speaking these things unto them, behold a certain ruler 
came up, and adored Him, saying: Lord, my daughter 
is even now dead; but come, lay Thy hand upon her, 
and she shall live. And Jesus, rising up, followed him, 
with His disciples. And behold a woman who was troubled

with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind Him, and 
touched the hem of His garment. For she said within 
herself: If I shall touch only His garment, I shall be healed. 
But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said: Be of good heart, 
daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman 
was made whole from that hour. And when Jesus was come 
into the house of the ruler, and saw the minstrels and the 
multitude making a rout, He said: Give place, for the 
girl is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed Him to 
scorn. And when the multitude was put forth He went in: 
and took her by the hand. And the maid arose. And 
the fame hereof went abroad into all that countrv.

that there are any intervening Sundays between the 23d

suffering, with joy giving thanks to God the Father, Who 
hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints 
in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of dark 
ness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son 



Epistles and Gospels. 1191 

of His love, in Whom we have redemption through His 
blood, the remission of sins. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xxiv. 15-35. At that time Jesus said 
to His disciples: When you shall see the abomination of 
desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, 
standing in the holy place, he that readeth let him under 
stand: Then they that are in Judea, let them flee to the 
mountains, and he that is on the housetop, let him not 
come down to take anything out of his house: and he that 
is in the field, let him not go back to take his coat. And 
wo to them that are with child, and that give suck in those 
days. But pray that your flight be not in the winter, or 
on the Sabbath: for there shall be then great tribulation, 
such as hath not been from the beginning of the world 
until now, neither shall be. And unless those days had 
been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake 
of the elect those days shall be shortened. Then if any 
man shall say to you: Lo, here is Christ, or there, do not 
believe him. For there shall arise false Christs and false 
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, inso 
much as to deceive (if possible) even the elect. Behold 
I have told it to you beforehand. If, therefore, they shall 
say to you: Behold He is in the desert, go ye not out: 
Behold He is in the closets, believe it not. For as lightning 
cometh out of the east, and appeareth even unto the west: 
so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Whereso 
ever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered 
together. And immediately after the tribulation of those 
days the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give 
her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the 
powers of heaven shall be moved. And then shall appear 
the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all 
tribes of the earth mourn: and they shall see the Son of 
man coming in the clouds of heaven with much power and 
majesty. And He shall send His angels with a trumpet, 
and a great voice: and they shall gather together His 
elect from the four winds, from the farthest parts of the 
heavens to the utmost bounds of them. And from the 
fig-tree learn- a parable: when the branch thereof is now 
tender, and the leaves come forth, you know that summer 
is nigh. So you, also, when you shall see all these things, 



1 1 92 Epistles and Gospels. 

know ye that it is nigh, even at the doors. Amen I say 
to you, that this generation shall not pass till all these things 
be done. Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words 
shall not pass. 



festivals of tbe 

CANDLEMAS DAY. PEBRUAKY 2. 

COLLECT. Almighty and everlasting God, most humbly we 
entreat of Thy majesty that, even as Thine only-begotten Son, 
clothed in the substance of our flesh, did this day vouchsafe to be 
presented in the temple; so, our hearts having been purified by 
Thy grace, we likewise one day may be presented to Thee. 

EPISTLE. Mai. Hi. 1-4. Thus saith the Lord: Behold 
I send My angel, and he shall prepare the way before My 
face. And presently the Lord Whom you seek, and the 
angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to 
His temple. Behold he cometh, saith the Lord of hosts: 
and who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? 
and who shall stand to see him? for he is like a refining 
fire, and like the fuller s herb : and he shall sit refining and 
cleansing the silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, 
and shall refine them as gold, and as silver, and they shall 
offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice. And the sacrifice 
of Juda and of Jerusalem shall please the Lord, as in the 
days of old, and in the ancient years. 

GOSPEL. Luke ii. 22-32. At that time: After the 
days of her purification according to the law of Moses were 
accomplished, they carried Him to Jerusalem, to present 
Him to the Lord, as it is written in the law of the Lord: 
Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the 
Lord. And to offer a sacrifice according as it is written 
in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle-doves, or two young 
pigeons. And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named 
Simeon, and this man. was just and devout, waiting for the 
consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was in him. 
And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, 
that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ 
of the Lord. And he came by the Spirit into the Temple. 
And when His parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do 
for Him according to the custom of the law: he also took 
H m into his arms, and blessed God, and said: Now Thou 



Epistles and Gospels. 1193 

dost dismiss Thy servant, Lord, according to Thy word, 
in peace: because my eyes have seen Thy salvation, which 
Thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples: a light 
to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy 
people Israel. 

FEAST OF ST. PATRICK. MARCH 17. 

COLLECT. O God, Who for the preaching of Thy glory among 
the Gentiles wert pleased to send forth blessed Patrick, Thy con 
fessor and pontiff; do Thou through his merits and intercession 
grant, that what Thou commandest us to do, the same we may 
by Thy mercy accomplish. 

EPISTLE. Ecclus. xliv. 17, 20, 22, 27; xlv. 3, &amp;lt;?, 20. 
Behold, a great priest, who, in his days, pleased God, and 
was found just: and in the time of wrath was made a recon 
ciliation. There was not found one like him that kept the 
law of the Most High. Therefore with an oath the Lord 
made him to increase among his people. He gave him 
the blessing of all nations, and confirmed His covenant 
upon his head. He acknowledged him in His blessings: 
He preserved for him His mercy; and he found grace before 
the eyes of the Lord. He glorified him in the sight of kings. 
and gave him a crown of glory. He established with him 
an everlasting covenant, and gave him a great priest 
hood, and made him blessed in glory. To execute the 
office of the priesthood, and to have praise in His name, 
and to offer Him a worthy incense for an odor of sweetness. 

GOSPEL. Matt. xxv. 14-23. At that time Jesus spoke 
this parable to His disciples: A man going into a far 
country, called his servants, and delivered to them his 
goods. And to one he gave five talents, and to another 
two, and to another one, to every one according to his 
proper ability: and immediately he took his journey. 
And he that had received the five talents went his way, 
and traded with the same, and gained other five. And in 
like manner he that had received the two, gained other two. 
But he that had received the one, going his way digged 
into the earth, and hid his lord s money. But after a long 
time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with 
them. And he that had received the five talents coming, 
brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver 



1 194 Epistles and Gospels. 

to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over 
and above. His lord said &amp;gt;to him: Well done, good and 
faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a 
few things I will place thee over many things, enter thou 
into the joy of thy lord. And he also that had received 
the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two 
talents to me: behold I have gained other two. His Lord 
said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because 
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place 
thee over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 



FEAST OF ST. JOSEPH.

COLLECT. May the merits of the Spouse of Thy most Holy 
Mother profit us, O Lord: and may his prayer win for us those 
blessings which we of ourselves avail not to obtain. 

EPISTLE. Ecclus. xlv. 1-6. He was beloved of God, 
and men: whose memory is in benediction. He made 
him like the saints in glory, and magnified him in the fear 
of his enemies, and with his words he made prodigies to 
cease. He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave 
him commandments in the sight of his people, and showed 
him His glory. He sanctified him in his faith and meek 
ness, and chose him out of all flesh. For He heard him, 
and his voice, and brought him into a cloud. And He 
gave him commandments before his face, and a law of 
life and instruction. 

GOSPEL. Matt. i. 18-21. When Mary, the mother of 
Jesus, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, 
she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost. Where 
upon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not 
willing publicly to expose her: was minded to put her 
away privately. But while he thought on these things, 
behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, 
saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee 
Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her, is of 
the Holy Ghost; and she shall bring forth a Son: and 
thou shalt call His name JESUS: for He shall save His 
people from their sins.

ANNUNCIATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. 

MARCH 25. 

COLLECT. O God, Who didst will that at the message of an 
Angel Thy Word should take flesh in the womb of the blessed 
Virgin Mary: grant unto us, Thy suppliants, who believe her 
to be in very truth the Mother of God, to be helped by the prayers 
she puts up to Thee on our behalf. 

EPISTLE. Tsaias mi. 10-15. In those days the Lord 
spoke to Achaz, saying: Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy 
God, either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height 
above. And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not 
tempt the Lord. And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house 
of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, 
that you are grievous to my God also. Therefore the 
Lord Himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin 
shall conceive, and bear a son, and His name shall be called 
Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and honey that He may 
know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good. 

GOSPEL. Luke i. 26-38. And in the sixth month, the 
Angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, 
called Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name 
was Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin s name 
was Mary. And the angel being come in, said unto her: 
Hail, full of grace: the Lord is with thee: blessed art 
thou among women. Who having heard, was troubled 
at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of 
salutation this should be. And the. angel said to her: 
Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. 
Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt. bring 
forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name JESUS. He shall 
be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, 
and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of David 
His father, and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for 
ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end. And 
Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I 
know not man? And the angel answering, said to her: 
The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of 
the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore 
also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the 



1196 Epistles and Gospels. 

Son of God. And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also 
hath conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth 
month with her that is called barren: because no word 
shall be impossible with God. And Mary said: Behold 
the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to me according to 
thy word.

COLLECT. Impart to Thy servants, we beseech Thee, O 
Lord, the gift of Thy heavenly grace, so that we, for whom the 
bringing forth of her divine Child by the Blessed Virgin was the 
beginning of salvation, may, on this joyful festival of her Visita 
tion, be blessed with an increase in peace of heart. 

EPISTLE. Cant. ii. 8-14. The voice of my Beloved, 
behold He cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping 
over the hills. My Beloved is like a roe or a young hart; 
behold He standeth behind our wall, looking through the 
windows, looking through the lattices. Behold my Be 
loved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, My love, My 
dove, My beautiful one, and come. For winter is now 
past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers have appeared 
in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the 
turtle is heard in our land: The fig-tree hath put forth her 
green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. 
Arise, My love, My beautiful one, and come: My dove in 
the clifts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, show 
Me thy face, let thy voice sound in My ears: for thy voice 
is sweet, and thy face comely. 

GOSPEL. Luke i. 39-47. And Mary rising up in those 
days, went into the hill-country with haste, unto a city of 
Juda: And she entered into the house of Zachary, and 
saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass, that when Eliza 
beth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in 
her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
and she cried out with a loud voice and said: Blessed art 
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord 
should come to me? For behold, as soon as the voice of thy 
salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb 



Epistles and Gospels. i*97 

leaped for joy. And blessed art thou that hast believed, 
because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken 
to thee by the Lord. And Mary said: My soul doth 
magnify the Lord; and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my 
Saviour. 

ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN. 

AUGUST 15. 

COLLECT. Forgive, we beseech Thee, O Lord, the sins of Thy 
servants; and may we, who of ourselves are unable to please 
Thee, be saved by the prayers of the Mother of Thy Son, our 
Lord. 

EPISTLE. Ecclus. xxiv. 11-20. In all these I sought 
rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord. Then 
the Creator of all things gave His orders, and said to me; 
and He that made me rested in my tabernacle. And He 
said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance 
in Israel, and take root in My elect. From the beginning 
and before the world was I created, and unto the world 
to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling 
place I have ministered before Him. And so was I estab 
lished in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and 
my power was in Jerusalem. And I took root in an hon 
orable people, and in the portion of my God His inheritance, 
and my abode is in the full assembly of saints. I was 
exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress-tree on 
Mount Sion. I was exalted like a palm-tree in Cades, 
and as a rose-plant in Jericho: As a fair olive-tree in the 
plains, and as a plane-tree by the water in the streets was 
I exalted. I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aromat- 
ical balm : I yielded a sweet odor like the best myrrh. 

GOSPEL. Luke x. 38-42. At that time: He entered into 
a certain town; and a certain woman, named Martha, 
received Him into her house. And she had a sister called 
Mary, who, sitting also at the Lord s feet, heard His word. 
But Martha was busy about much serving; who stood and 
said: Lord, hast Thou no care that my sister hath left me 
alone to serve? speak to her, therefore, that she help me. 
And the Lord answering, said to her: Martha, Martha, 
thou art careful, and art troubled about many things. 



1 1 98 Epistles and Gospels. 

But one thing is necessary. Mary hath chosen the best 
part, which shall not be taken away from her. 

FEAST OF ALL SAINTS. 

NOVEMBER I . 

COLLECT. O almighty and everlasting God, by whose 
gracious favor we on this single festival day render solemn 
homage to the merits of all Thy saints: most humbly we pray 
that since so great is the number of Thine elect pleading in out- 
behalf, we may partake, in all their fulness, of Thine abounding 
mercies. 

EPISTLE. Apoc. lii. 2-12. In those days behold I saw 
another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having 
the sign of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice 
to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth 
and the sea, saying: Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor 
the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in their fore 
heads. And I heard the number of them that were signed, 
an hundred forty-four thousand were signed; of everv 
tribe of the children of Israel. Of the tribe of Juda, were 
twelve thousand signed: of the tribe of Ruben, twelve 
thousand signed: of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand 
signed: of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand signed: of 
the tribe of Nephthali, twelve thousand signed: of the tribe 
of Manasses, twelve thousand signed : of the tribe of Simeon 
twelve thousand signed: of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand 
signed: of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand signed: 
of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand signed: of the tribe 
of Joseph, twelve thousand signed: of the tribe of Benjamin 
twelve thousand signed. After this, I saw a great multitude, 
which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes^ 
and_ peoples, and tongues; standing before the throne, and 
in sight of the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms 
in their hands: and they cried with a loud voice, saying: 
Salvation to our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and 
to the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the 
throne, and the ancients, and the four living creatures: 
and they fell down before the throne upon their faces, and 
adored God, saying: Amen. Benediction, and glory, and 
wisdom, and thanksgiving, honor, and power, and strength 
10 our God for ever and ever. Amen. 



Epistles and Gospels. 

GOSPEL. Matt. v. 1-12. At that time: Jesus seeing 
the multitude went up into a mountain, and when He was 
set down, His disciples came unto Him, and opening His 
mouth, He taught them, saying: Blessed are the poor in 
spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are 
the meek: for they shall possess the land. Blessed are 
they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed 
are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall 
have their fill. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall 
obtain mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart: for they 
shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall 
be called the children of God. Blessed are they that 
suffer persecution for justice sake: for theirs is the 
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when they shall revile 
you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against 
you, untruly, for My sake: be glad and rejoice, for your 
reward is very great in heaven. 

IMMACULATE CONCEPTION OF THE 
BLESSED VIRGIN. 

DECEMBER 8. 
r \&amp;gt; -.-, J-^ 

COLLECT. O God, who, by the Immaculate Conception of 
the Virgin, didst make ready a fitting dwelling-place for Thy 
-Son;, grant, we beseech Thee, that as through the death fore- 
seen try Thee of the same Thy Son, Thou didst preserve His 
Mother unsullied by sin, so, us likewise, pure in heart, Thou 
wouldst make to come unto Thee. 

EPISTLE. Prov. mil. 22-35. The Lord possessed Me 
in the beginning of His ways, before He made anything 
from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of 
old before the earth was made. The depths were not as 
yet: and I was already conceived: neither had the foun 
tains of waters as yet sprung out: the mountains with 
their huge bulk had not as yet been established: before the 
hills I was brought forth: He had not yet made the earth 
nor the rivers nor the poles of the world. When He pre 
pared the heavens I was there: when with a certain law 
and compass He enclosed the depths: when He established 
the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters: when He 
compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the 



i2oo Epistles and Gospels. 

waters that they should not pass their limits: when He 
balanced the foundations of the earth, I was with Him 
forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing 
before Him at all times: playing in the world, and My 
delight is to be with the children of men. Now therefore, 
ye children, hear Me: Blessed are they that keep My 
ways. Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not. 
Blessed is the man that heareth Me, and that watcheth 
daily at My gates, and waiteth at the posts of My doors. 
He that shall find Me shall find life and shall have salva 
tion from the Lord. 

GOSPEL. Luke i. 26-28. And in the sixth month, the 
Angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, 
called Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose 
name was Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin s 
name was Mary. And the angel being come in, said unto 
her: Hail, full of grace: the Lord is with thee: blessed art 
thou among women.
