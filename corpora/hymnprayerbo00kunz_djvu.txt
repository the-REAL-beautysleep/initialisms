PREFACE, 

1 HE German Churches in America have 
always been endeavoring to keep up their lan- 
guage, and have never neglected the propet 
means for this purp fe', Thty have cretSed 
every where fchools, and they catechife their 
children in German. Thcie endeavors are 
founded neither in a contempt of the Janguage 
prevailing in this part of the world, nor of 
the other proteftant religious focieties ; but m 
the nature of things. Parents arrive in this 
country without a competent knowledge of the 
Engliih. They- either find German churches 
e&amp;abliftied, or they come in fach numbers to 
a place as to be able to efcablifh them. There 
is then no queilion about the language. But 
the entrance of any religious fociety i? con- 
nected with an implicit engagement to be and. 
remain a lupporter of it. I know of. no au- 
thority comaiiflioned to difcha-rge any one 
from this obligation, except the interference 
of cenfeientious icruples atjeut the faluL: 
of the doclrlne. Any o ther'Von fid e ration that 
ever induced a perfon to break up the mrm 
b e r fh i p with a c o n gv c ; a \ i c 1 * t i

PREFACE. 

in forae parts a difficulty begins to appearand 
this is in populous cities, where their number 
is fmal!, and in lome country diftricls, where 
ihciriettlements are mixed withEnglifhpeople. 
Here the children of the German parents, be- 
ing not in the lead aided by any German 
converiation in common life, and in ibme 
places not even enjoying an uninterrupted 
church fervice every Sunday, do not find the 
means fupplied by the ichools, which teach 
the German, iufneient to render the German 
churchifervice ufeful to them. The relult of 
tills observation is not with us, that they mud 
quit their connection, this would be a moral 
impoilibility for the mod or them. For they 
e, at their confirmation, entered the fo- 
lem^i promife of fahhfulnefs as long as they 
d the doctrine confonant to Icripturc : but 
i hat the ufc of the Engliih, in iuch places and 
congregations ought to be connected with the 
German, and this both in the church and 
ichool, as the French Hugenotsdo in all chief 
ics in Germany,.- with the French and the 
V'crniaus. Asthis hasbeen done already in fome 
itheran congregations in New Jeriey, and in 
is ftate, this little collection is intended to 
red to the evangelical brethren for 
ir ufe in the above mentioned purpofes, in

PREFACE, 



the German Pfalmody, printed in London and 
re-printed at New-York, by H. Gaine, 1756, 
with which many ferious Engliih pcrions have 
been greatly delighted ; and from an excel- 
lent collection- of the Moravian Brethren, 
printed in London, 1789. In the appendix 
only I have taken the liberty to add a few of 
my own, and of the Rev. MeflVs. ErnfVs and 
Strebeck*s, both translations and original com- 
positions. 

The tranflation of the Liturgy, Catechifm, 
and Order of Salvation is done by my worthy 
afliftantin preaching, Mr. Streheck, and the 
reft added by myielf, except the Prayers, 
which are taken from Jos. A Heine's excellent 
little work, * An Alarm to Unconverted Sini 
ners.' It was the intention, likewiie, to add 
the Augiiftan Confeflion, and Mr. Strebeck 
has actually tranQated i: from the Latin. But 
a difinclination to fwell the fize of the book 
was at this time preponderating. It is howe- 
ver ready, and can, at the defire of any one, 
who would not fpare the expenccs, be printed 
iingly. 

May the adorable Lord and Mafter, whofe 
church has always been uled and inclined to 
ling hispraifes, and who inhabits the praifes 
of his Ifrael, deign thefe endeavors of a por- 
tion of his bleffings, that with this little book 
in the hand and the contents in the heart, many 
fouls, families, and congregations may woi&gt; 
&amp;ip him in the beauty of holinefs.

ADVENT amd CHRISTMAS. 

I. TUNE 3. 

NOW the Saviour comes indeed, 
Of the virgin-mother's feed, 
To the wonder of mankind, 

By the Lord himfelf defign'd. 
2. Not begot like men unclean, 
But without the ftain of fin : 
In our nature God was born, 
Us to fave ; who were forlorn. 

g. Though the virgin was with child, 

Chaftity prov'd undefu'd ; 
All the female virtues were 

Thron'd in her, for God was there. 

4. From his chamber forth he went ; 
Left the glorious element ; 

And, at once both Gcd and man, 

He his biefled courfe be-. in. 

%\ From his father's bread he came ; 

And return 'd to him again. 
Having fir ft our foes to quell, 
Triumph'd o'er death and hell. 

6. O thou God-like evqry way, 
Carry thy victorious fway 

In the flefii to fuch a length, 
That we gain thy Godly frreiigfifc 
H

T. InrJ, thy crib fiiines bright and t, 
Cbacing darknefs every where, 

Let no fin o'er-cloud tins light, 
That our faith be always bright. 

t. Glory to the God of love ! 
Glory to his fon above ! 

Glory to the fpirit be ! 

Glory to the foleflcd I3rree. 

2. 25. 

HOW fiiall I meet my favio-ur I 
How fliall I welcome thee .' 
What manner of behaviour 

Is now required of me ? 
Let thine illumination 

Set heart and hand* aright. 
That this my preparation 
Be pleafing in thy figljt. 

2. W'liilft wit'i rb$ gnyeft flower'; 
Thy Zion drew? the way, 

I'll raife with all rr;y powers 

To thee, a great fu I lay ; 
To thee the King of Glory 

I'll tune a iong divine ; 
And make thy love's bright [lory 

Jn oraceful numbers fhine. 

3. What had thou not performed. 
Lord to retrieve my lofs, 

While I was to deformed 

By I'm and belli ft drofs ?

Brought my redemption near,

My ffimie 1 was bemoaning ; 

Wiih grace thou cloathcdit me. 
Thou raifeft ms to glory ; 

Endow'il me with thy blifs, 
Which is not tranfitory, 

As worldly treafure is. 

5. What caus'd thy incarnation ? 
What brought thee down to me J! 

Thy love to my fa! vat ion 

Contriv'd my liberty, 
O love, beyond exprefijon ! 

Wherewith- thoa doft embrace 
Mankind in its bigreffion 

From thee, the iource of gra-:e„

Heal up your wounds wit IS iff* 

Ye fons of deflation, 

That feel the fraarr or frn. 

Take courage, your fa'vatiojj 
Stanch waiting at rhetor ; 

The go*pe i -con to 1 kt ion,

When thus prefented by our Saviour, 

HeaTd. by his wounds, from fin redeem'd, 
They prove the Father's love and favour, 

Who owns them as his fons and heirs, 

And all he hath their own declares. 

Eternal life they now inherit, 

Procured for them by Jefu's merit ; 

He dwells in them, in him they live-, 

Since jefus finners doth receive. 

5. Could I his loving, heart but fee, 

And know his bowels of companion 
To Tinners, ft raying carelefsfy, 

Or fuch, as mourning feek falvation. 
Kim, when on earth *mitd(l finners trace 1 
Zaccheus taftes his faving grace. 
He comforts Magd'len in afBiclion, 
Ixegards her tears and deep conviction ; 
Her (ins though many, he forgives ; 
My Saviour finners poor receives. 
^&gt;. Behold how he with Peter dealt, . 

Though deep his tall, he fhow'd him favour- 
Not only when on earth he dwelt 
Was he a fin— forgiving Saviour ; 
No, he is Mill the very fame,, 
Juft good and merciful his name; 
As he was in humiliation, 
So is he ft ill in exaltation. 
Repenting fouls you my believe, 
Our favionr finners doth receive. 
7. Come, finners, come, though vile and bafe $ 

Returning prodigals he meeteth ; 
He freely offers them his grace, 

Them with a pard'ningkifs he greeted 



9 2 Repentance. 

Why wilt thou (land ift thy own way ? 
Why, wilfully, befarau's prey ? 
Wilt thou fin's drudge remain for ever, 
Though he appear'd thee to deliver? 
Do not delay, fin's fervice leave, 
Since Jefus Tinners will receive. 

8. Come, ye that heavy laden are, 

Come weary, void of ielf-afTiftance ; 
Though doubting, ready to defpair ; 
Come but to him without reiift mce. 
Behold his heart, with love replete, 
Full of defire the word to meet ; 
Long hath he fought for you, though wretched, 
You to embrace, his arms outftretched : 
Othen but come, believe and live ; 
My Saviour finners doth receive. 

$. Don't fay : (t IVe been a wretch toobxfe^ 
"Too oft his goodnefs I have flighted, 

'•Too often fpurnedar his grace, 
4i ], who was geii'rouily invited.'* 

Is yo"ur repentance now fiucere ? 

Your for row genuine .' Do not fear, 

His pow'r and mercy are unbounded ; 

Mqdc, trading him, was e'er confounded.. 

He faves, whom nothing can relieve. 

My Saviour finners doth receive. 

10, Perhaps its time enough," you'll fay,, 
God who is gracious beyond rneafure, 

"The doer of grace won't fhut ro day ; 
*'j'II firft enjoy fome carnal' pleafixre.' 7 

No, God forbid ! do not defpife 

Grace, that's now oiFer'd, if you're vufe. 



Repentance. 9$ J 

Who flights to-day the inv nation, 
Jv'av ever mifs of his falvation. 
Come now to Jefus, cowe and live ; 
To-day he tinners doth receive, 

Xi. Draw me, a f.-nner, unto thee, 

Thou tinner's Friend, thou gracious Saviour } 
Grant I, and all, may ardently 

Defire thy pardon, grace and favour. 
When fin aflails. and gives us (mart, 
Show us thy wounded loving heart ; 
May none, who feels fin's condemnation 
Neglect tjiygen'rous invitation, 
But all experience and believe 
That Jefus Tinners doth receive ! 



73- 3- 

&gt;^T OW begin, the heav'nly theme ; 

Sing aloud in Jefu's name ; 
Ye, who jefu's kindnefs prove, 
Triumph in redeeming love, 

2. Ye, who fee the Father's grace 
Beaming in the Saviour's face ; 
As to heav'n ye onwards move, 
Praife and blefs redeeming love. 

5. Mourning fouls, dry up your tears 
Banifli all your guilty fears ; 
Jefus will your guilt remove, 
Prompted by redeeming love. 

4. Ye alas ! who long have been 
Willing flaves of death and fin ; 
Now from blifs no longer rove, 
Stop and talte redeeming love. 



94 Repentance. 

5". Welcome all by fin oppreft, 
Welcome all to Jefus Chrift, 
Nothing brought him from above, 
Nothing but redeeming love. 

6, He fubdu'd th' infernal pow'rs; 
His tremendous foes and ours 
From their curfed empire drove, 
Mighty in redeeming love. 

7- Sing, ye ranfom'd, to his prVife, 
Tnne^our fongs to grateful lay3 ; 
Mortals join the holts above, 
join to praife redeeming love.

Repentance. 9£ 

Bat mould be hopelefs and forlorn 
Uncertain where for help to turn 

If I had not thy promife. 
.4. But thy reviving gofpel-word, 

Which leads me to falvation, 
Doth joy unfpeakable afford, 

And lafting confolation. 
For there I read, thou'lt not difdain 
A broken heart, replete with pain, 

That turns to thee, O Jefus. g^. 

5. Me, heavy-laden finner, hear, 
Who make 'fore thee confeffion ; 

To my complaints now lend an ear. 

Regard my fupplication. 
My longing is : O warn me clean 
From ev'ry fpot and ftain of fin, 

Like David of Manafieh^ 

6. Lord, I approach thy mercy-featj 
And pray thee to forgive me ; 

With contrite heart I thee intreat, 

Show pity and receive me. 
Call all my fins and trefpafiee 
Into the ocean of thy grace, 

And them no more remember. 
'* O, for thy name fake let me prove 

Thy mercy, gracious Saviour.

With an eye of love look down, 
Help,, Lord, help me very foon. 

g. Break, O break this heart of (lone; 
Form it for thy ufe alone; 
Bid each vanity depart, 
Build thy temple in my heart. 

4. This be my fupport in need, 
That thou didft fo freely bleed: 
Hence my joys and hopes arife 
From thy bloody facrifke. 

5. This confirms me, when I'm weak, 
Comforts me, when I am fick, 

Gives me courage, when I faint, 
Well fupplies my ev'ry want. 

6. Saviour, to my heart be near, 
Exercife thy fhepherd's care ; 
Guard my weaknefs by thy grace,

His precious word hath promis'd me, 
That he'll my joy and comfort be ; 
Thereon is my reliance.

Yet grace ftill more aboundeth : 

Sufficient help io him is found, 

Where fin most deeply woundeth,

Who his loft iheep doth feck and lead 
With tender love and pity.

Concerning the manner of public wor/hip, in the 
linked congregations of the Evangelical-Luthe-~ 
,taa church in North America. 
I. 

PUBLIC worfliip is always to be introduced with' 
a verfe (or a few verfes) of a fuitable hymn ; 
after the fingingof which the minifter fteps before 
the altar, and addreiTes the congregation as fol-* 
Jows : 

Dearly beloved 
Thus faith the high and holy one, that inhabiteth 
eternity, whofenameis Holy ; I dwell in the high 
and holy place, with him alio that is of a contrite 
and humble fpirit ; to revive the fpirit of the hum- 
ble, and the heart of the contrite ones. For I 
will not contend for ever, neither will I be always 
wroth •&gt; therefore acknowledge your mifdoings, 
and confefs your fins before the Lord your God. 

For he hath promifed that if we confefs our fitjf, 
lie is faithful and juft to forgive us our fins and 
to cleanfe us from all unrighteoufnefs. 

All ye then that are prefent, confefs with me 
^our Tins in the folding manner ; 



Liturgy- i 

I thy poor Tinner acknowledge before God my 
heavenly father, that 1 have fadly, deeply, and in a 
manifold manner finned againft thee ; not only 
with outward fins, but more abundantly Co with 
insvard blindnefs, unbelief, doubts, defpair, im- 
patience, pride, finful felf-love, evil defircs, covet- 
oufnefs, private envy, hatred ar?d ill-wii], toge- 
ther with many other evil deeds which are all well 
known to God, and which alas S 1 myfelf cannot 
fo perfectly know. And now (O Lord) thefe things 
grieve, and canfe me for row., and I defire fervent- 
ly to receive forgivenefs and grace through thy 
well beloved Son Jefus Chrift : making now a frefh 
dedication of myfelf to thee, with a fincere pro- 
mife through the affidance of thy holy fpirit to live 
more holy and obedient unto thee. Amen. 

Lord God our heavenly Father have meicyupon 
us. 

Lord Jefus Chrift_, the Saviour of the world have 
n^ercy upon us. 

God the Holy Ghoft have mercy upon us, and 
grant us thy peace. Amen,

The m'uiifter further address the congregat'io?i a-

thing which by nature it cannot have ; that it be-

be received into the bonds of Chrift's holy Church,

PRAYER. 
Let us fray* 

O almighty and everlafting God, the Father of 
our Lord Jefus Chrift, we call upon thee in the be- 
half of this child, which now, through us begs thy 
baptifmal blsfting ; and defires thy heavenly grace 
through fpiritual regeneration. Receive the fame, 
O Lord, as thou haft declared : Afk and ye fhall re- 
ceive, feek and ye fiiall find, knock and it mall be 
opened untoyou : thereforegrant robeltow thy blefl- 
iiig unto this child that afks ; open the door unto 
it feeing it knocks ; that it may thereby obtain the 
everlafting bleftmg of thy heavenly covenant, and 
receive the promiied kingdom of thy grace, thro' 
Jefus Chrift our Lord. Amen. 

Let us hear the wards of the goftel written by St. 
Marky in the ro/7; Chap. from the iphto 16 verfe. 

u They brought young children to Chrift, that 
" he mould touch them. And his difciples rebuk- 
*' ed thofe that brought them ; but when Jefus faw 
" it he was much difpleafed, and faid unto them, 
'* fuffer the little children to come unto me, and 
'* forbid them not, for of fuch is the kingdom of 
Ci God. Verily I fay unto you, whofoever fliall 
*' not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, 
e&lt; he fliall not enter therein. And he took them 
*' up 10 his arms, put his hands upon them, and 
*&lt; bleffed them." 

Following this example, we blefsthis child, lay 
our hands upon hitu. and pray in the following 
jjianner : 

Our father which art in HeavcVj ifc. 



Liturgy. ?o 

Hereupon the minifter puts the following ques- 
tions to the fpohfoi'S. 

Do re renounce, in the name of this child, the 
devil and all his works and all his ways ? Yes, 

Do you believe in God the Father almighty ma- 
ker of heaven and earth ? 

J believe. 

Do ye believe in Jefus Chrift, his only begotten 
fon, our Lord ; that he was conceived by the Ho- 
ly Ghoft ; born of the Virgin Mary .; that he fuf~ 
fered under Pontius Pilate ; was crucified, dead, 
and burVed, he defcended into hell ; tliat he rof'e 
again the third day; that he aflcended into hea- 
ven, and fitteth at the right hand of God the Fa- 
ther Almighty ; and that trotn thence he will come 
again at the end of the world, to judge the quick 
and the dead ? 

Yes, J believe. 

And do ye alfo believe in the Koly Ghoft ; the 
holy Catholic Church ; the communion of faints j 
the remiffion of iins ; the refur recti en of the body ; 
and everlafting life after death ? Yes. 

Is it your defire, that this child mall be batuteed 
jn this faith, and in the foregoing prornife r Yes. 

Baptifm is not alone mere warer, but it is that 
water which the command of God epjoins and 
■which U connected with his Word. 

What ihali the name of this child be ? 

N. N. J baptise thee in the name of the Father, 
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoft. 

Hereupon the congregation fings the following 
hymn, 

His bath his meal and preaching 
Are ordinances teaching 
That faith and not fruition

As we are gathered together here, in The naxe 
of the Lord to receive his holy teflament, my ex- 
hortation to you is fir ft, that you lift up with me 
your hearts to the Lord, praying with me the 
i.ord's prayer, as Chriit our Lord has taught us,. 
and promifed to grant us our petition. 

That God,, our heavenly Father, would merci- 
fully behold us, his poor children, and give grace 
that his holy name may be fancnfietl among us and 
5 n all the world, by pure and ju(t doctrine of his 
Word and fervent love in life ; avert gracioufly all 
errors in doctrine and vices in life, by which his 
holy name is difhonored and blafphemed ; that his 
kingdom may come and be promoted, and he would 
bring all fmners,. who are blinded and captivated 
by the devil, to the knowledge of the true faith in 
jefus Oliriit his Son, and increafe the number of 
the Chriftians : That wc may be Hrergthened by 
his fpirit, to do and to fufTer lirs wsir, both in life 
and de^th, and break, offer up and mortify our 
own will, both in good and bad thing* : That he 
would grant us our daily bread, keep us from a- 
varice and furrows for the belly, and give u* con~ v 
fldence to expert every good thing in abundance 



Liturgy. 14 

from him. That he would remit us onr debts as 
we remit our debtors, that our hearts may enjoy 
a chearful confidence before him, and we may have 
reafon not to fear fin or be terrified by it. That 
he would not lead us in temptation, but affift us by 
his fpirit to overcome the fiefh, difpife the world 
with all its works and conquef the devil with all 
his devices ; and that at laft he would deliver us 
from all evil, both corporal and spiritual, tempe- 
ral and eternal. Thofe who defire all this, will 
then confirm it with their amc7i, believing without 
all doubt, that it be fo', and the -prayers heard in 
heaven, as Chrift promifes, whatfoever yon zfk, 
believe that you will have it, and it ihall be done. 

Mv fecond exhortation, which I give in the Lord 
Chrift, is, that you direcl your full attention in 
true faith to the teftament of Chrift ; and particu- 
larly to the words in which Chrift gr nts us his 
body and his blood for the remiflion of fins, ap- 
prehending them firmly with your heart, remem- 
bering with gfatefulnefs his unfathomed love 
demonftrated unto us by redeeming us through his 
blood from the wrath of God, death and heli, and 
thus receive externally the bread and wine, that is, 
with and under it, his body and blood, for your 
allurance and pledge. 

We therefore blefs, -admimfter and ufe in his 
r.ame, and purfoant to his command; his holy tef- 
taraent in the following manner. 

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed he thy 
Fame. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in 
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our dai- 
ly bread, and forgive us our trefpafles as we for- 
give them that trefpafs againft us, and lead us not 
into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine 
is thekingdom, and the power, and the glory, for 
ever and ever. Amen. 

Our Lord Jefus Chrift, in the night in which he 
was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given 
thanks he brake it, gave it to 'his difciples, anil 
fcaid : Take, eat, this 5s my body, given for you,- 
Do this in remembrance of me.

law. For this, Thou malt not commitadultery, Thou 
flialt not kill, Tkou (halt not (teal, I hou malt net 
bear falfe v/itnefs, Thou flialt not covet; and If 
there be any other commandment, it is briefly- 
comprehended in this faying, namely : Thou /halt 
love thy neighbour as thyfelf. Love worketh no 
ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling 
of the law. And that, knowing the time, that now 
it is high time to awake out of fleep ; for now is 
falvation nearer than when we believed. The

his perion, and upholding all things by the word

The Gojpjl. S. John i. 1. 

IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word 
was with God, and the Word was God. The 
fame was in the beginning with God. Ail things 
were made by him, and without hirrrwas not any 
thincmaue, that was made. In him was life, and 
the lie was the light of men. And the light fhin- 
cth in darknefs, and the darknefs comprehencletk 
it not. There was a man fent from bed, wbofc 
name was John. The fame came for a wh'nefs, to 
bear witnefs ofth? light, that all men through him 
mio-ht believe. He was not that light, liac was 
fent, to bear witnefs of that light. That was 
the true Rghf, which lighteneih every man that 
cometh into the world, lie was in the world, and 
the world was made by him, and the world knew- 
him not. Hecame unto his own, and bis own re 
ceivert him not. But as many as received him, to 
them cave he po^er to become the Sons «f God,

TTTHEN much people were gathered together,

fpake by a parable : A fower went out to fow his 
feed : and as he fowod, feme fell by the way -fide, 
and it was troden down, and the fowls of the air 
devonred ir. And fome fell upon a rock, and as 
foon as it was fpruno; up, it withered away, be- 
caufe it lacked moifture. And' fome -fell among, 
thorns, and the thorns fprang up with it, and 
choked ir. And others fell on good ground, and 
fprang up, and bare fruit an hundred-fold. And- 
when he had faid rhefe things, he cried, Ke that 
&lt; hath ears to hear, let him hear. And his difci-

be ? And he laid, Unto yo\i it is given to know 
th® miileries of the kingdom, of God : but to others 
in parables; that feeing they might not fee, and 
hearing they, might not understand. Now the pa- 
rable is this : The feed is the word of God. Thofe 
by the way-fide are they that hear : then cometh 
the devil, and taketh away the Word out of their

on the rock, are they ; which when they hear, re- 
ceive the word with joy ; and thefe have no root, 
which for a while believe, and in time of tempta-

thorns, are they, which when they had heard, go 
forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and; 
pleafures of this life, and bring no fruit to per-

ceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowfhip 
with the unfruitful works of darknefs, but rather 
reprove them : for it is a fliame, even to fpeak of

HpELL me, ye that defire to be under the law,

Abraham had two fons, the one by a bond-maid, 
the other by a free-woman. But he who was of 
the bond-woman, was born after the flelh ; but he 
of the free woman was b\ promife. Which things 
are an allegory : for thefe are the two covenants; 
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to 
bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount 
Sinai in Arabia, and anfwereth to Jerufalem which 
now is, and is in bondage ..with her children. But 
jerufalem which is above, is tree ; which is the 
mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou 
barren that beareft not ; break forth and cry, thou 
that travailed no' : for the defolate hath many 
more children than (he which hath an hisfband. 
Now we, brethren, as Ifaac was, are the children 
of promife. But as then, he that was born after 
the flcfli, perfecuted him that was born after the 
Spirit ; even (0 ii is now. Neverthelefs, what 
faith the Seriptur ? Caft out the bond-woman and

8. Thon flialt not bear falfe witnefs againft thy

We mould fo love and fear God, as not tobelie

What is that. 

God threatens to punim all wlio tranfgrefs thefe

Ills difp-leafure and not act contrary to his laws.— 
But he promifes grace and all good things to tbofe, 
whokeep the Commandments ; therefore v/e mould 
iove and have confidence in him, and willingly 
do what he has commanded us. 

PART II. 

The Creed. 

The fir ft Article — Of the Creation, 

I -believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of 
heaven and earth. 
What is that. 

1 believe that God has created me, and every 
creature ; that he has given me a body and foul, 
eyes, ears and all my members, that he has given 
and preferved to me reafan, that he has added to 
thefe an underftanding, food and raiment, houfe 
and every convenience, wife and children, field 
cattle and all goods, necefiary for the maintain- 
ance of body and life, that he provides me with it 
in a rich meafure and daily, that he protects me 
lrom all dangers and from all evil, and this all 
entirely by fhewing of divine love, fatherly care 
and mercy, without any of my own worthynefs or 
merit : for all of which I am in duty bound to 
praife, thank and faithfully ferve toim. 

This is mod eertainly true. 

The Second Article. — Of the Redemption. • 

Aad in Jefus Chrift, his only Son, our Lord ; 



iji Cathcchifm, &amp;c. 

who w^s conceived by the Hclv Ghoft, born of the 
Virgin Mary, fuffered under Pontius Pilate, was 
crucified, dead and buried : He defcended into 
hell ; the third day he rofe again from the dead : 
be afcended into heaven, and fitteth on the right 
IkiikI of God the Father Almighty ; from thence he 
fuall come to judge the quick and the dead. 
What is that ? 
I believe, that Jefus Cbrift, true God begotten 
©f the Father from all eternity, and alfo true man 
bom of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord ; who has re- 
deemed, purchafed, and won'me a loft and con- 
demned perfon from all fin, from death, and from 
the power of the devil, not with gold or filver, 
but with his holy precious blood, and with his in* 
nocent fufferings and death, that! might be his 
■own, live with him in his kingdom, and ferve him 
in everlaftiug right eoufnefs, innocence, and hap- 
pinefs, even as he is rifen from the dead, and now 
lives and reigns to all eternity. This is mod cer- 
tainly true. 

The third Article .—Of Santtificaiion . 

T believe in the Holy Ghoft ; the holy Catholic 
Church, the communion of faints, the forgivenefs 
of fins ; the rcfurrection of the body, and the life 
everlaftiug. Amen. 

What is that t 

I believe that I have it not in my power, through 
rny own ftrength or rcafon, to believe in, or come 
to Chrift, but the Holy Ghoft has called me through 
the gofpel, illuminated me by his gifts, fanctified 
and kept me in true faith, even as he calls, gathers, 
illuminates, and fanclifies the whole Lhriflian 
Church on earth ; and eftablifhes them in Chrift, 
through fa'nh : in which Church he daily, and rich- 
ly forgives me, and all that believe, all our fins— 
and that in the laft day will raife me, together with 
all the dead, and will grant unto me, with all true 
believers in Chrift an everlaftiug life. This is mod 
certainly true.

PARV I\ r . 
Of the Sacrament of Baptifoii 

Q. Wh.it is Edptifm P 

A. Baptifm is not only mere water, but it is ihit 
Water aimed at in God's commandment and unitci 
with hj| word. 

a What it the 



95 Catechifm, &amp;c. 

A. That which our Lord Chrift Paid, go ye and 

teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
lather, and ot* the Son, and of the Holy Ghoit. 
Q. What are thi benefits of Baptif; -' 
A. It caufes the forgiveuefa of tin, redeems from 
■death and the devil, and gives ever.lafting falvatioii 
t© thol'e that believe, as the word and promifcs of 
God declare. 

(X, IVhich are ihtfe words and promifes of Cod P 
A. Thoi'e in which cur Lord declares (Maik 
j*6, 16,) Ke that believes and is baptized Ihall be 
faved, but he that believes not ihall be damned. 
Q^ How can water do fuch great things P 
A. It is not the water that does them, but the 
%vord of God, which is connected with the water ; 
for without the word or' God, the water, is mere 
water, and does not constitute a baptifm : but 
with the word of God it is a baptifm, that 
\% to fay a graceful water of life, and the' 
Jove of regeneration in the Koiy Ghoft, as Paul 
faith to Titus, chapter 3, 5, and 6 (even " accord- 
ing to his mercy hath he 'laved us by the warning 1 : 
of regeneration, and the renewing of the holy 
jghoft, which he fried on us abundantly through 
Jefus Chrift our Saviour," that thereby we might be 
made righteous, and be heirs, according to the 
hope of everlading life. This is mod certainly 
ti ue. 

C). What does fuch a water- Baptifm fgnify f 
A. It fignifies that the old Adam fhall daily 
through fincere forrow and tepentance for fin, be 
drowned, and die with tue whole mafs of fin and 
evil concupifoence ; and that we fhall daily a rife 
as new creatures, who in righteoufnefs and true 
holinefs fhall dw-ell with God forever. 
O. Where is this f aid in the Scriptures P 
A. St. Paul in his epillle to the Romans, ch. 6 v. 4 
faith, " We are buried with him by baptifm : that 
like as Chrift was railed up from the deafl by the 
glory of t:he Father, evea &amp; we alio fhould walk 
in newneCs of life."

Ot the Sacrament of the Altar. 

(y What is the Sacrament of the Altar. 

A. It is the true body and blood of our Lori 
Jefus C tori ft, given under bread and nn inc, unto u-* 
CiirilHans to eat and drink, as it was ir.llitu-ted by 
Clirift himfeif. 

O. Where is this Written I 

A. The holy Evange lift's Matthew, Mark and 
Luke : together with holy Apoltle St. Paul, vvroie 
hus. 

(t O.ir Loro^Jefus Chrilt in the night in which he was 
" betrayed, took bread, and when he had given 
'&lt; thanks he brake it, and gave to his difciples fay- 
f* ing, Take eat, this is my body which was given 
jP for you. This do fri remembrance of me." 

At the fame time, after the fuppe'r, fre took the 
fcu'p, give thanks and gave it to them faying: 

" Take ye and drink all of this cup, which is 
" the New-Teftament in my blood, that was med 
f 4 for you' and for many f for the femifiion of fin-. 
&lt;c Da this, as aft a-sr ye drink it (in remembrance 
"of me."' 

O. How ca?i corpcreal eating and drinking effctl 
fnch great things ? 

A. Jt is not the eating and 1 drinking fliaf doili 
fhefe things, but the words connected wfth ic 
" Which' Was gtve'in, a'nd fired for you, for' the re- 
fnifllyn of fins," which words are to be confide red 
be&amp;des the literal eating and drinking as the chief 
points in the Sacrament : wherefore whofoever be- 
lieves thc'fe words has what they promife even the 
forgivenefs of fin'. 

Q. Who is it that receives- this Sacrament wcr-~ 

A. Receiving it witrifaftirig and external prepa- 
ration is indeed a fi-ne external difcipline: but he jjji 
really worthy, and a proper gueft, who has faitfctf 
«»■ thofe words- ; which was (lied for you for il,^

WE daily Teethings rife, which were not be- 
fore, and we ourfelves were not a few years 
hence. This leads us to a fuppolition, that there 
is an author of all things , who always was and whofe 
being is neceilury. In contemplating the affairs 
of this world, wedifcover footlteps of his govern- 
ment &amp; in the order of things, the change offeafons, 
the motion of heavenly bodies, the provifion for 
wants and neceffities, his omnipotence, wifdom and 
benevolence are difcoverable. Tkisbeingwe calj 
God. 

The wifdom of God gives us reafon to believe, 
that men were made for a certain purpofe. We 
are confeious of our exigence, have free will, are 
capable ofgood or bad actions, may hurt or affifl 
others. It mud be the will of the benevolent cre- 
ator, that we mould do good unto others. That 
he however made us capable of the contrary 
fhews us, from what fource the propenfity to do 
good unto others mud arife. It is the beauty of 
holinefs, to be willing to pleafe God, and this wiN 
lingnefs proceeds from love. To love God fupreme- 
ly and to fliew this by obedience to his law, is an- 
fweringthe end and purpofe of God's creation. Do- 
ing the contrary, makes us culpable. 

The obligation on oar part, to do good unto 
our fellow-creatures for the fake of him who crea- 
ted us andthem, is felt by every rational creature. 
It is the law of God written into the hesrts of all 
men ; yet it is confirmed by experience, equally 
ger -al. that a difinctinativn~\o the performance of 
this acknowledged duty prevails in the human race, 
A propenfity to evil fo general is not deducibie 
from a mere poffibility of doing it. This poiliUj- 



i t 5 Christian Religion, &amp;c. 

lity prefuppofes a divine plan iri the creator, to 
have mora] agents in (his world ; a plan perfecl'y 
compatible with his wiidom and benevolence, pro- 
vided he makes the knowlcdge-of his will attaina- 
ble. But befides this podibiiity of moral evil there 
feems to he among men a general confpiracy to ir. 
This myfterious appearance feems only to be diflb- 
luble by hiftoricai accounts. But historical ac- 
counts reft upon relation, not upon reflection cr 
contemplation. 

A thought of another and never ctafing life after 
\V\\ ptefeut, has like wife as generally asthefenfe 
of duty pervaded mankind ; efpecially the think- 
ing and wife part of it, The excellency of our 
mental faculties, the general defireofa continu- 
ance of life, and a defect in the rewards and pn- 
nifhments, feemingly due to virtue and vice, in 
this life, are the arguments alledged in favour of 
fuch an expectation. Though thefe arguments are by 
no means without their weight, a predifpofition de- 
pending upon fome implanted notions has undoubt- 
edly aided an acqutefcence in the expectation of a 
future life fo general and of fo important confe* 
quences. 

The Chriftians are a people, who claim a cer- 
tainty in the knowledge of thefe things from hiflo- 
rial accounts. Thefe accounts to them are {tamped 
with infallibility, and the chief matters they con- 
tain are the fallowing : 

I The exigence of one Cod, though diltinguifha- 
ble in three per/on*, z His tout, that rational be- 
in gs mould demonftrate their love to him by free 
obe -c ice, for which purpofe laws were given and 
freedom of will for choofing the good or bad im- 
planted into them. Good and bad is the name of 
obedience and difobedience, on account of the dif- 
fer it confequences, good and pleafmg fenfations 
or iri and mifery. r l he latter was tc confift in a 
teparation of the foul from the body, and the form- 
er in everlafting continuance of this connection,

3 T"he/I-7/&lt;? 0/ thetyrfl man and wotaan and the «**«- 
n;r, in wJ&amp;/^ Mtf* ajf'etts all their pojlentj. A ra- 
tional being having been with others in a fimilar 
ftate of trial, and having forfeited its happinefs 
by difobedience, in confequence of which it wa? 
under an expectation of the divine puniihnient, dil- 
covered an inclination to involve the new created 
race in its fate. This fpirit, called Satan, was in 
to far fuccefsful, as to produce in the fir ft man and 
woman the act of tranfgreffion, but as it was ef- 
fected by mifreprefentation, the iflue was not 
deemed a fufficient evidence of the difpofition of 
their will. As Satan could not have acted with- 
out a divine permiffion, fomething iimilar may be 
luppafed to have preceded to what occurs in the 
hiitory of Job, when the fame apoftate fpirit was 
permitted to attempt the depravation of this pious 
man. With the permiffion to tempt the firft of the 
human race was connected the liberty to repeat 
the fame \*ith each individual of their pofterity. 
To derive original Tin from the firft man's being 
the federal head of the human race, feeins not fa- 
tisfactory to a mind inclined to derive only good 
and perfect things and gifts from the good and 
perfect creator. We are born in Tin, becaufe the 
Satanic invitation to fin begins early and with our 
very appearing in the world. He may be refilled, 
but before we come to reflect on the neceffity of" 
doing this we have yielded to his temptations and 
are tranlgrellors of the law. By one mans difo- 
bedience, it is true, many were made finners, but 
not on account of an imputation of this man's fin, 

t&gt;ut becaufe by him fin entered into the world 

Death fo paflL-d upon all vnen, fince after him all 
have finned. The permiffion thus granted to the 
tempter flowed from wifdom and love, for obedi- 
ence connected with frugle difcovers the attach- 
ment of the foul and entitles the conqueror to a 
permanent truft. But in this cur firft parents 
tailed and yielding to a furprifing and fubtil ene- 
PJ they opened the door to moral depravity be-

Truth being a divine attribute, without which 
no obligation to obedience can take place, becaule 
There can he no dependence on his manifefted \s i 1 J , 
death by the traofgreffion of the law is rendered 
inevitable. But the inclination to fin not having 
originated in the bread of men, juftice, love and 
wifdom was difplayed in a fyftem, which Mill be 
1 he object of eternal admirarion and according t o 
which God will appear juft and true and yet the 
julHder of them that have finned- The indication 
ofthe time, when death mould follow fin, was no 
part ofthe divine threatning. The intention was 
only to fay, that death would be the confecjuence 
of fin, on what day, or at what time foever this 
might happen. Men were therefore fuffered to 
continue, and the before intended propagation fif- 
teen was not prevented from taking place, though 
iheywete put under rettrains and fignal marks of 
divine difpleafrre, and the mean or immortality^ 
(for indifloluble their body Mas not created, the 
fv item in which they were not being the intended 
permanent one,) removed from their eyes. 'I he 
a- pb ft ate fpirit who thus became 'he murderer of 
mankind, in the mean time was addrefled by Gcd 
3:1 a langU3ge, undoubtedly unintelligible at that 
linie to him as well as to our firfi parents, but con- 
taining terms clear enough for the latter to form a 
confolatory idea of their iituatiou, which was con- 
firmed immediately to them by the continuation of 
t.ie divine moral government over them. Of this 
word of God to latan the event wiil juftify the 
following paraphrsie : "by attacking ti.e mother 
of all living, thy imagination was, to have the 
whole of her pofierity. But there fhall be two 
parties againfl one another in it thy party and the

Men were now under a, bad influence, bu this mull 
hevot" be untie r flood to reach la far as to f rce cr 
determine the will ; it con(ifts in deceitful perfua- 
li )iis, like that in the beginning, and by that i\m 
underltanding becomes dark'ned- Eph» 4, 18, until 
by degrees the not refilling will fink into perfect 
lhvery. To fuppofe the devil incapable of procre- 
ating thoughts in men, is fuppofmg him to be in- 
ferior in po wer to men, for we are sbie to do it by 
various means ; and to charge the LhritHans with 
the abfurdity of admitting an omniprefent devil, 
is overloT&gt;k*ng the fcripture-accour.t of the multi- 
tude of Satan's adherents in the world But in the 
continuance of the moral government of God with 
men it was obfervable, that God by an immediate 
.interposition counteracted this bad influence jn 
ail fuck, as difcovered a better difpofition cftke heart, 
TranfgreiTion was not entirely prevented by this 
mod gracious divine interference in any of the na- 
tural offspring of Adam, "but afuL d {/approbation of 
every immoral action and a gradual advancement in 
the habit of riffling the temptations was the confe- 
quence. As this divine operation upon the mires 
of them was a real and immediate act of God, it js 
afcrihed to that peribn in the triune deity, which 
is often reprefemed as the executive in the crea- 
ting power, and therefore is fa id to proceed from 
God. The fpirit of God moved upon the face of 
the waters, when the earth was to be formed, Bv 
the fpirit of the mouth of God ail the heavenly hofts 
were made. L hri = t a 1 , a man afliimed human nature 
in the womb of toe virgin Mary, not by the natu-

able divipe favour. Men in the iv.ian time were 
permitted and commanded to worihip Cod, he- 
caufe inch acts of devotion difcover the difp fuion 
of the heart towards him. \\ hen this worfliip be- 
^an to decline in the world, God faw, that his ipi- 
j it could not prevail -and continue his falutarV ope- 
rations ani lie would rather deftroy the whole hn- 
man race from the earth, than furfer the Satanic 
feed alone, contrary to his former declaration, oc- 
cupy the world, ■ When after this detfruction, 
where one family only remained, the new race 
paid more attention to the perfuafiors of the prince 
of the world (hah to the invitations of the Tpir it from 
heaven, God feparated a family from all I he others 
nnd eftablilhed his worfliip in It, for the purpofe 
of preventing forever the entire extirpation of an 
holy feed from the earth. Wherever God is wor- 
ihipped and his word purely taught, there his fpi- 
rit works, and for the uninterrupted continuance 
of fuch worfhip and doctrine among the people a- 
rifing from the above faid family ample provifion 
was made. 

S s 

Wtiilft many recieved the grace of God in vain, 
in others it became themore powerful, and to Come 
of fuch God condescended in particular revelations. 
Abraham the head of this family heard a promife, 
that from his offspring happinefs mould I e fpread 
over all the nations of the world. The fame was 
repeated to his fon and grandfon. This la it. died 
with this prophecy in his mouth, addrefTed to one 
of his fons : his pofterity mould not undergo en 
entire diflolution, but retain the form of go\ em- 
inent until the conqueror fliould come, unto whom 
the gathering of the people would be. To Mofes, 
David and many eminent teachers of this people 
the fame pronrlfe wars repeated, and what lie was 
to do in terms fometimes plain, fometimes more 
obfeure declared. To the more plain belong the 
following defcript ions. lie mould defcerd from 
Jj e lineage of David the king of this people, fliouM

perform many miracles, yet undergo hard fi.frVr- 
inos and a cruel death. Neverthe'Ms atrer this 
death he mould continue to live, and then as ^king- 
tor ever reign. From the exprefiions ufed in the 
promife which was made to David, this people 
called the Jfraelites and afterwards the Jews, were 
in the practice to diftinguifli this expected perfon- 
age by the name of the Anointed or Median. The 
Jevrifh conceptions of the nature and office of the 
Mefliah were always different, hut the expectation 
of fuch a perfon was general and firm. .1 he pious 
approached always the neareft to truth* Dark no- 
tions in our creed do never endanger our falva- 
vation, if the clearer are unattainable. He who 
;n the whole world before 'the appearance of the 
Mefiiah wifted to come to God, had to believe, 
that he is, and that he is a reward er of them, that 
diligently feck him. Such as truly believed ahd 
considered this, would worfhip him, and by thefe 
means be rendered fufceptible of the fpirit of God 
counteracting the temptations of Satan. Faith and 
only faith was always, fince the fall, the way to 
the favour of God, becaufe the humiliation of ere 
foul before him, and the readinefs to admit refor- 
mation prefuppofes that, but the object of it is not 
more, than what God has clearly revealed. The 
explanation of the nature and office of the Mefliah 
was referved to the time of his appearing. 
§6 
About four thoufand years after thatgrest pro- 
mife, made to Adam, which rekindled a hope of 
divine favour in him, a perfon appeared in the 
country of the Jews, whole name was Jef'us, 
who declared himfelf to be the Meffi?h. KU de-

In the night proceeding the death of the Meffi- 
ah, who on account of the greek language prevail- 
ing at that time in the world, is called by the 
greek name ChrHt, and his followers, Chriftians, 
there was a kind of facrifice celebrated, called the 
paflover. The Jews had many facriflces, which 
all were an emblem of the offering of an innocent 
life for the guilty, Some of fuvh fa«rifice$ wer^

burnt, Tome eat by the minifters of religion, b*t 
tlie palTover was eat by ctll the rrofcl:ors of the 
Jewifli religion, which had the intention- of point- 
ing out the mode of participation of the facriiice. 
This is effected by an union with the fucrifke. Af- 
ter Cftrift had celebrated this with his diiV.iples; 
he took bread and wine, gave ir to Irs difciples 
and declared that eating and drinking this fliould 
be a participation of his lacrihce, and that this 
fnould be a continued cuftom among them. This 
in fact was an abrag.uion of alj facrifices, as- be- 
ing typical and now fulfilled, and the eftablifii- 
ment of the Chriilian Church by the will and Tef- 
tament of Chrilr, or the new covenant in contra- 
dithndion of the old, made by Moles. Kxod; 24, 
5, 6, with the prefigarative blood. This was the 
appropriation of Chritt's facrifice to the Cliurcb, 
and therefore juftificaticrt of all its prefent and fu- 
ture members at once, provided they were fuicere. 

Sincerity difcovers itfelf in the fubmiffion," un- 
der the revelation of God, if that has fufficient cri- 
terions of truth, in the grateful reception of the 
offered grace, and in the profeffion of it before 
men. 

The Jews had had a cuflom among themfelves 
before the appearance of Chrift, to incorporate 
fuch of the gentiles into their nation, as wifhed 
•with them to wormip the God of Ifrael as the o-n- 
]y true God, by diping them under water, figni- 
•fving on the part of the thus baptized an acknow- 
ledgement that they before were unclean and now 
by the incorporation into Ifrael cleara. But fhort- 
iv before ChriiVs public appearance and at his time 
there was a great prophet commiflioned by God, to 
declare the Jews themfelves unclean and to preach 
to them that repentance, they preached to the 
Gentiles. '1 lie well difpofed humbled themfelves, 
acknowledged the neceilitv of a regeneration and. 
were baptized as if from Gentiles they became 
Jews. John, this was the name of the prophet, 
declared unto them, that he rould not give the 
holy Ipirit and that he was not Chrift, but that he 



\2$ Christian Religion, Sc£. 

would come after him, and was now among tkem. 
A3 hisbaptifm neverthelefs figniried regeneration, 
which even Jofephus, a Jewifh writer, who made 
no profeffion of* chriltianiry , t eRifies ( Jew.Antiq. 
1. i3. c. 7.) it w«s on the part cf the baptized a fo- 
lema declaration of the neceflity of regeneration. 

Chrift now commanding his difciples to ellabli fh. 
his religion in the world, directed rliem. to remain 
at the capital cf the jewifli country, till they had 
received the Holy Ghoft, whom he would fend 
.them, and then they mould preach the gofpe], that 
is to fay, remiilion of fin, removal of its punifh- 
rnent, death and favor of God, unto all nations. 
He who would receive Chrift as his faviour and 
Lord, for this is believing, and who would fufter 
liimfelf by baptifm, and confequently by public 
tarofeliion of the religion of Chrift, to be incorpo- 
rated into the church, eftabliihed on the evening, 
preceeding his death, (hould be delivered from 
death, The other, that would reject that offer, 
would remain under the fentence of condemnation. 
They that would make fuch profeftion of faith, 
ihould be taught by the apoftels, whatever Chrift 
had commanded, and as the Jewifli teachers ufed 
to baptize in their name and confequently upon 
their doctrine, and were then called the fathers of 
fuch profclytes, but Chrift had forbidden, to call 
in fuch a fenfe any one father, they were only 
commanded to baptize in the name of the Fathtr, 
the So7i and the Holy Ghofl, and not in their name. 

That there is a plurality in the deity, although 
there is but one God, is pcrcievablc from the hilt— 
ory of the creation, where we read of a divine 
confutation, and in m.inyplaces of thefacred record. 
But the matter was not cleared up, the prophets 
always declaring that an enlargement of the know- 
ledge of God, as well as a general diffufion of it 
in the whole world, wouldbe referved to the days 
of Meftiah. A meflenger of God, however, who is 
God, and a fpirit of God is often fpoken of Chrift 
now l'.\ putting thefe three perfons together and

making them the fathers of the baptized, afcribing 
them a name, that is personality, and directing 
the baptized, to look up to them only as their lea- 
ders, the Father as the God of if) ael, the Son as 
Chrilt fent by him to redeem the world, the Holy- 
Spirit, fent by Chrift, to counteract the temptati- 
ons of the devil and remove the difficulties ariiing 
from ignorance and depravation, has given us as 
clear ideas of a triune God, as our undenlandjng 
in the world of trial and imperfection is capable to 
receive As Chrift fays once, land my father are 
one, thefe tfe-ree perfons are one. They conftitute 
one God. God and each perfon in God is the 
objecVof the adoration of the baptized believers, 
and in addreiTing the Father we pray to the 
Son and Koly Ghoft. T here is no dif- 
ference in inereft or feparatitn in government or 
divcrhty in will and inclination. J£ the chriftian 
church is wrong in this interpretation of the fcrip- 
ture &gt; the error was unavoidable, and the fvieffi.ali 
kingdom which was according to the exprefs lan- 
guage of the prophets to deltroy idolatry in the 
world, bj the moft exprefs language of the Melilah. 
and his meflengers has eltabliflied it. hriftians, 
who worfhipthe Father, Son and the Holy Ghoft 
as the only one God, are the true unitarians and 
the antitrinitarians, who niuft and do v»cknowledge 
that Chrift is ftiled God in the bible (fee Wolzoge- 
nii opera ad Luc. 24, 52. they worfhipped him, 
fince they acknowledged his divine majefty, and 
at John 1,1. he is God, but not the higheft God) 
admit of more Gods, but one iviagiftrates are 
called the Gods of the earth, but never abfolutely 
Gods. 

The apoftles remained at Jerufalem, and being 
gathered together on a Jewifh feftival, on which 
they celebrated the Sinaitic legifiation which had 
conftituted them the people of God, they received 
in a manner percievable by rheir ovn and the ex- 
ternal fenfes of others the Holy Ghoft, that is to 
Jay, a rich meafure oflui ^ifts, for two or three

grca* purpofes : firft, Jefus was by this in the 
mod folemn manner declared to be the Meiliah, 
for ftom liim the Jews expected the Holy Ghoft, 
Rom i, 4. Secondly, Jefus fhewing himfelf as the 
fountain of the holy fpirit, declared all fuch his 
members., as ever had received and would receive 
the fame. Thirdly, Jefus enabled his meflengers to 
preach with power his gofpel in the world, for he 
functioned their million as God had formerly done 
tn'tne-sriflion of Mofes Exod. 4,3. to eftablifh 
their credibility. The performances of miracles 
in the premHive Church was a notorious thing. 
Suetonius calls the the chriltians therefore force- 
rers .(Nero 6.) and tUe apoliogifts, fpeaking of the 
miracles of the chriftian^, appeal to the facts and 
to general knowledge. 

Clirift's meflengers tlms indructed and qualified, 
made the begining of executing their office with 
the Jews, of whom many thoufands were incorpo- 
rated. They had a period of grace of forty years 
after which their government was deftroyed and 
ceafed, becaufe to Ghrift was the gathering of the 
people. God has not caft his people away, for 
every individual of them, and they altogether may 
be ingrafted into Chri(t, but the people of God, 
the holy lfrael are now the cliriftian. That lfrael 
according to the flefli is fuftered to remain 
di(lin guUhable in the world, is to witnefs 
to the uorld the truth ofthe bible. All the briU- 
liant nromifes, made to the people of God in the 
latter times, belong to the fpiritual lfrael, the 
church of Chriit. lfrael according to theflefhwas 
the people, unto which were committed the ora- 
cles of God. Thele are now committed unto the 
chriftians. It fell, that the whol *. lfrael might be 
faved, to which if the&gt; will, they may belong. 

The apoftels went from the Jews to the Gentiles, 
where they met with the moD unexpected fuccef*. 
They eltabiifhed every where churches fwt in or- 
er things that were wanting and ordained elders 
or teachers in every city- The congregations thus

the collection, called the old .teftsment, are accord- 
ing to the teiV.rjionies of the two jew im writers,

Tbe facred books of the Je wifli Church are writ- 
ten in Hebrew, and the remnants of the apoirolic 
inftruclions in Greek : languages, which are both 
now dead in the world. This creates for the 
teachers ofthe Church o'f Chriif. the necefilty ot 
learning thefe languages, and as for learning fuch 
dead languages many things are requif.te, as hif- 
tory, antiquities &amp;c. many of which are axtaina- 
ble by the medium ofthe Latin language ; it can- 
not be againft the will of our Lord, that t lie roierfl

they are not pious, the detrimental conl'eqr.cnctis 
can only be felt by thep.i, not by the ckurch aieriv-

and follow it; from the fcriptures being written

there is no elect church, no congregation of faint?, 
no meeting of good people.'' 

The initiation of a new church-member, by bap- 
tifsu, may be done in the public affembly, or in 
private in the prefence of witnefles, becaufe we 
find both modes practiied in the primitive church. 
The time and age of a perfon, who is to be initi- 
ated, we likewife find no where precifely profcrib- 
ed. The Chriftians follow therefore the church 
practice, and found reafon. The Jewifh church 
hud circumcilion for its initiation. Circumcilion 
made a perfon debtor to the whole law, Gal. 5, z. 
jfo baptifm obliges to the obedience of Chrift, and 
is called the circumcifion of Chrilt, or the Lhrif- 
tian circumc-ifion. Col. 2, 11.. No fhadow of doubt 
remains therefore, that,tlie ChriOian children are 
thus to be initiated- Some parents once brought: 
children to Chrift, that he fhoulcl touch them. Ke 
complied wi-th the requeft, and we think his act 
net an indifferent one. Jewifh children were then 
taught, and after their arrival to the years of dis- 
cretion, publicly examined and as children of the 
law received into the congregation. This chrifti- 
ans like'vife da, and the latter is an act that ihould 
never be done in private, becaufe the congregati- 
on is fuppefed to give its confent to the recepti- 
on, and to witnefs, that the teacher has done his 
tluty in inflructing the new member. This act, 
called confirmation, is only to be done with fuch 
as were baptized before they could be instructed. 
Thus Chrillians are a people, who believe that 
faith in Jefus Chrift gives the hope of eternal life 
and makes holy. Of fuch as are not made holy by it, 
they judge, that though they profefs with the 
mouth, they believe not in the heart ; and of fuch 
"who find the evidences of Jefus's million into the 
world not convincing enough for their understand-

THAT the enemy would fow diflentions and er- 
rors into the Ch urch, the Lord himfelf has de- 
clared and his apoftles have repeated it, Matthew 
25, 13. 1 Tim. 4, T. Paul and John both teftify, tha-t 
this happened already in their time. They both, 
however, prophecy of a more alarming and gene- 
ral decay of Mie chriftian church. Here too the 
divine permiMion of the evil, as in the cafe of the 
h'iman fall, is founded in wifdom and benevolence. 
Had there been no bead and no image of the beall, 
there could not be a congregation of fuch excel- 
lent fouls, as are difcribed, B.ev. 15,2. at the fea 
of jilafs mingled with fire that had gotten the vic- 
tory over the beaft and over his image. To him 
that overcomes glory, crown and life is promis- 
ed, and the Lord by his wife permifiions takes 
care, that fouls difpofed to be engaged for their 
Lord, may not mifs their aim. 

The beaft Jtrft mentioned is the degenerated 
church, and its image, its idolatrous mode ofwor- 
fhip introduced by perfecution and violence, the 
phrafe being taken from the image of Nebucbodo- 
nofor intruded as the object ofwerfhip, under the

which foon furpafled the horrors of all the perfe-

the abfnrd doclrine of tranfubitantiation, wliich 
eftabliflied a new kind of idolatry, and that of a 
purgatory, which brought forth the Irrationaland 
fuperftitious mafs and the blafphcming indulgen- 
cies. Befules ibis the Latin language was introdu- 
ced in divine fervice, no word of God preached or 
explained, the cup taken from the people in the

which arofe fcandals beyond comprehension. 

Againft thefe, and other ruinous errors and a-

many of the reft ( Lud. Lavater. hiflor. Sacranf. 
Fol. 33 )cor. feffes this, though it is the opinion of 
many, that Zwingle had begun in the year 1716. 
Zwingle disagreed with Luther in the point of the 
Lord's Supper, where he maintained, that the 
words of the institution, this is my body, this is 
my blood, were to be taken in a figurative fenfe : 
breaking the bread and drinking the wine, mould

the death of the Saviour. Luther and his : 
ates did not think them feL es emitted ro fucti an 
explanation. Every exertion of faith excites fuch 
a remembrance. Here are the words o! a t ele- 
ments, not of a parable, where "this is, r.ie be, 
this figniiics." The bread and the wine are fymbols 
rid hot the body and blond of the Lord. But if 
1, giving a paper to a perfon, fay : take this, this 
is my houi'c, no perfon miltakes the meaning. 
Paul fays, i Cor. 10, 16, that the bread, we break 
is the communion with the Lord's body. Eating 
therefore this bread is in confequence of this uni- 
on, eating the Lord's body. Of the mode of this 
union we ought not to attempt an explanation — 
Let it be called a facramental union, becaufe 
there is nothing in the nature of things, that i!- 
Juftrates it or is like it. But remain firmly by the 
Words : this (eating) is (eating) Ch rift's body. 
Zw ingle \a1io in 'he year 1529* was pre lent at a

that cuuld be kep without fin or fuperfition. 

In the year 1550. Luther and his aflociates pre- 
fented their confefiion of faitli to the emperor 
Charles V. and the diet of Augiburg. 

In the year following the protectant princes and 
dates made a covenant and league together at 
Smalcalden, of which the elector of Saxony and 
the Landgrave of Hefle were the heads. Not all 
the Lutherans, however, joined it. 

?n the year 1535. The pope propofed a council 
to beheld at Mantua, for which purpofe the. pro- 
tectants drew up fome articles at Smalkalden, to 
lay them before the council, which articles now, 
though the council was not held, belong the Sym- 
bolical articles of the Lutheran church. 

In the year 15^9, the kingdom of Denmark wag 
reformed according to the principles of I uther by 
the inltrumenuly of Dr. Bugenhagen, who was 
advifed by Luther not to abrogate bifhops, as they 
had done in Saxony. 

In Sweden a difciple of Luther, Olaus Petri had 
preached againft popery foon after the reformation 
of Saxony : but the Lutheran church was not fully 
eflabliihed before the year 1593. 

Zwingle had died in a war, where he as a Swifs 
citizen had been obliged to appear, in the year, 
1 53 1 . Fiveyears after John Calvin, a native of 
France, and a truly pious and learned divine, came 
to Bade in the Swis country, and pubiiihed there 
his inftitutions in divinity. He coincided with 
Zwingle's notions.but added atenet of a divine ab- 
folute predeftinanon to life and damnation, as it 
was formerly maintained about the year 847 by 
one Godfchalc, His exprelu ons were as itrong in

the means, to hear his word, or renders them by 
the preaching of it mere dupid and blind. This 
could not but enlarge the breach, lor the Lutherans 
had declared in their confeffion Art. 3. of the 
the fon of God : that Chrift had offered hhnfelf 
for all the actual lins of mankind, and had, Art. 
12. of repentance, rejected thofe, who deny, that 
fuch as were once juftided can loofethe holy Spirit. 
The Lutherans, therefore, hold and maintain a ge- 
neral conditional decree cf prededination under 
the condition of faith and perfeverance, at the 
fame time, when they declare, that men by the 
freedom of their will are not able either to begin, 
or' go through with any thing in things of God, 
without God's afiniance. The Lutherans with all 
their heart believe that it is God, v\ho works in 
them both to will and to do of his good pieafure. 
Becaufe by nature they were darkened and could 
not will, what they did not know. But a difpofi- 
tion, to do.the will of the creator, if only known 
will foon be follow.ed by a nearer call. The Spi- 
rit of Chrid will enlighten fuch as hunger and 
third, and by feeing now the means, formerly un- 
known, and by being allilted from above,, they vt ill 
find the freedom of their will redored for the pur- 
pofe of choling the true means to pleafe God. All 
men feel a natural adverhty againd divine things. 
But a wifh, that it may be otherwife, is not in- 
compatible with this captivity under fin. Bltd'ed, 
therefore, are fuch as hunger and third, for in 
them the Lord will begin, and i'r ih*e&gt; apply the 
means faithfully, hniih the work of falvation.

• he year following, ' Luther died. In the year 
1542 the Lutherans Sin Germany attempted the 
reftoration of biihops ; NieoUus de Armsdorf was 
made the firft Lutheran bifiiop in Nanmburg in 
Germany. Bat he being removed in the year 
1547, after the defeat of the protectants by 
ChsrlesV. the proteltants in Germany at the trea- 
vy of peace agreed to difcontiuuc, not the thing, 
hut only tiie name of biftiops, and called 
their eclefiaflical infpectors, fuperintendents. — - 
The revenues of the bifhopricks were generally 
applied to th? ufe of fchools and univeriities, in 
which, fmce that time, the proteftant countries ef 
Germtny, and particularly Saxony, Hanover and 
Wnrtemberg con-fefiedly excel!. 

In the Year 1545, the council of Trent begin. 
This council anathematized ail the doctrine of the 
proieftants, eftablimed all the abutes of the church 
of Rome, even fuch as had only crept in of late, 
and alianated the affections of the people, that 
wifhed only to conform their faith to the clear dic- 
tates of the word of God, from that christian 
church, which was pleafed to afliime for itfelf ex- 
clufively the name of the catholic, for ever. 

Soon after the death of that blefled inftrument ia 
the hand of God. Luther, the Sinalcatdean league 
made war with Mie Emperor, overlooking perhaps 
the warning, Revel. 13,10. and was defeated — 
The Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hefle 
were both taken prifoncrs, and the former lenten- 
ced to fulfer death. At the intercedion of Maurice, 
the due andafterwards Elector of Saxonv, this fen- 
tence was reverfed, bov Elector was deprived of 
his Elec'torihip which Maurice obtained. Among 
the articles propofed to him the captivejohn Frede- 
rick for fubt'eription, there was one : the Elector 
fhould promife, to receive and admit in things 
concerning religion, what the Council of Trent 
snd the. Emperor mould decree. This wis a ! &gt;fo-

advifable to infift upon that article. To fliew the 
world this example of conftancy and then turn the 
whole lor the bell of the protcftant caufe, wa: a 
motive in the divine wifdom fufheient to explain 
the permiflton of fuch a mournful cataftrophe. 
Maurice turned his arms now againft the Lmperor 
and compelled him in the year 1 552, by the treaty 
of Pafl'au, to grant to the proteftants the free exer- 
cife of their religion, which was confirmed and 
fully eftabliih by the peace of Augfburg in the year 
1555. 

The Lutheran Church is now the eftablifhed one 
in Sweden, Denmark, the kingdom of Pruftia, in 
three Electorates of Germany, viz. Saxony, Bran- 
denburg and Hanover, in many dr.cdoms and prin- 
cipalities, as Brur.fwick-Wolfenbuttle,~ Wirtem- 
berg, Baden, Hefle-Darmftadt, in many imperial 
citiss, as Franckfort, Augfburg, Hamburg &amp;c. and 
there are many of this confefTion, called the unal- 
tered Auguftan ConfefTion in contra-diftinction 
from the Zwinglan, in Poland, Hungary, Lngland 
Holland and in America. 

The government of this Church, as likewife ritu- 
al, it follows, is various. Where the rulers are 
of the fame confeffion, they follow their directions 
in external things, and for the ordination of the 
minifters thefe rulers eftablifh councils, called con- 
fiftories. But where this is not the cafe, or where 
the government is a republican one, the minifters 
together form a body for the purpofe of governing 
the Church and examining and ordaining minifters, 
as in Hamburg, Franckfort and America The 
minifters however are every where under the in- 
fpection of an eccleiiaftical overfeer, called bifhop 
in Sweden and Denmark and Superintendents, In- 
fpectors or Seniors in Germany. But their authority 
does not extend farther, than to admonifh, ex- 
amine matters of controverfy or complaint, and 
make reports to the conliftcfries or miniftries. 

The Lutheran Church has always been blelfeel 
with dhines eminent in literature and -piety.

the time of reformation the aflociates of Luther

particular revivals of religion in this Church. An

ten years afrer the death of Luther, called the true 
ChriiUauity, tranfl ted almoit in all the living lan-

ment with this Church 

To the peculiar bl tilings of this Church belong 
two things, winch fhouJd yet be mentjoried Tic; 
one is, mat it has not been diilraCted by non-ccn- 
formiry. lire Moravian brethren are not to be 
eonfidered as arifmg fryin them, for they were a 
branch of the Huflitic Bohemian Church, though 
many Lutherans and Calvinill have encreafed their 
Dumber, and though the Lutherans confider them 
as their brethren. The ether is a quite unexam- 
pled fondnefs of the members of this Church for 
fpiritaal hymns. The common people ivarn theni 
by heart and are initnicted by them and the fami- 
lies arc more frequently, than perhaps any where 
clfe, heard to Ling praifes to the Lord in their 
houfes. To find a thoufand hymns in a church. 
■mymn-book, is a thing quite common. 

In all the United States of America there are 
Lutheran congregations, except -New-Hampfliire, 
Vermont, Rhode-idasd and Connecticut. Jn Pen-

who died in the year 1-787, belongs the immortal 
honor of having formed in Pennfylvania a regular

that of having formed the Evai £tiical minillry o£

ciple of love to thee. 

Mortify in us all envy, hatred, malice and uncharita- 
blenefs : pluck up those roots of bitternefs our cf ou r 
mind?, and give us grace to love one another with a 
pure heart and fervently, as becomes the followers of 
the.Lord jefus, who has given us this as his ne.v com- 
mandment, C that brotherly love may continue amorg' 
us without diffimulation. 

We pray thee, rectify all cur miilakes ; if in any thing 
we be in an error, diicover it to u? : and let the Spi it 
of truth lead us into all truth as it is in Jefus : and give 
us that good underftandfng which they have that do 
thy commandments : and let our love and all good affec- 
tions abound in us Rill more and more in knowledge and 
all jaogcnent. 

Convince us, we pray thee, of the vanity of this worlds 
and its utter inefficiency to make us happy, that we may 
rever fet our hearts upon ir, nor raife our expectations 
from it ; and convince us of the vilenefs of fin, and its 
certain tendency to make us miferable, that we may hate 
K &amp; dread it &amp; every thing that looks like it, or leads to it. 
Convince us, we pray thee, of the worth of our own 
fouls, of the weight of eternity, and the awfulnel s of 
that cvcrlafting ftat* which we are llanding upon the 
brink of; and'make as diligent and ferious in our pre- 
paratioja for it, labouring chiefly, not for the mcaMhat

O that time, and the things of time, may be as 
nothing to us, v&gt; companion of eternity and the things 
thereof ; O that E ero'uy may be much upon our hea«r

and mult be fomewhere forever ; that we may "rejoice 
,f as though we rejoice not, and weep as though we weep 
r&lt; not,, and buy as though we poiTefTed nor, and may 
afe this world as not abuAng it," becaufe the fafhion of 
this world paiTetfv and we are palling away with it, (&gt; 
give us hearts truely mortified, cruGirled to the world, and 
may the world be cruci£ed to us.- 

O let thy grace be mighty in us and fufficient for os 
to prepare us for that great change which will com?; 
certainly and ihortly, and may come very faddenjjy, 
which will remove us from a world of (anfe to a world of 
fpirits j from or flate of trial and probation, to that of 
recompence and retribution ! and to make us meet for 
the inheritance of the faints in light,, that when we fail 
we may be received into eveflafting habitations. 

Prepare us, we befeech '.nee,, for whatever we may 
meet with betwixt \his evening and the grave. We 
know not what is before us, and therefore know not 
what particular proviiion to make, but thou doit ; and 
therefore we beg of thee to hit us by ihy grace for ail the
